- Location - This is displayed near the top of the application. It for display only.
- Latitude, Longitude - Use your smart phone or other GPS enabled device to determine your current location. You can also use [LatLong.net](http://latlong.net/)
- Celsius - Displays temperatures as celsius and wind speeds as kilometers per hour when checked
