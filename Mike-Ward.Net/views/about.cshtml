### About

I suppose I should put something quick and witty about myself here but then I'm neither so that's not going to work.
I enjoy writing software and have always enjoyed fiddling with technology.
I've been a pilot and a sailor, a beer maker and a woodworker.
There's not much that doesn't interest me as along has it doesn't involve religion or politics.

Mike-Ward.net is a personal project.
It gives me a place to try new technologies out, learn how to express myself through words and code and is my home on the Web.
Look around, read the blog, try the software and please send feedback.

Finally, while it should go without saying, it can't, given the awful behavior of some.
If you choose to contact me I won't spam you or sell your name or otherwise infringe on your privacy.
I have plenty of interesting things going on in my own life and that's enough for me.
Enjoy - Mike [mike@mike-ward.net](mailto:mike@mike-ward.net)
