  <h1><a id="preface" />Preface</h1>
  <p>I recently read a blog article about how writing one's own blogging engine is equivalent
    to writing yesterday's "Hello World" program. Everyone does one at some point. So
    here I am with my version of a blogging engine. My "interpretation" is a bit different
    than others perhaps in that I've expressed my engine as an ASP.NET user control.
    This packaging has advantages and disadvantages and you'll have to decide if it's
    right for you. One thing I can say is it has been fun to write and I've learned
    much about ASP.NET, a platform I have not programmed in before. I hope you find
    it useful and fun as well and always, send feedback. - Mike</p>
  <h1><a id="introduction" />Introduction</h1>
  <p>While developing the Blue Onion Software Web site I ran into an interesting problem.
    At one point I wanted to add a blog only to find that there was no blog control
    included with ASP.Net. A quick survey of the Internet revealed that there really
    wasn't anything much in the way of ASP.Net blog controls available. Furthermore,
    the blogging applications that did exist were designed for multi-author systems
    requiring database support and administration overhead that I really didn't want
    to deal with. Wasn't there a simple blogging control I could just add to my existing
    page layouts and that didn't require an expensive SQL Server and an investment in
    time to learn new templates syntaxes or setup user accounts? I couldn't find anything
    satisfactory so I bought a book on developing ASP. NET controls and went to work.
  </p>
  <p>I set few goals up front, which I've tried to adhere to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It had to be simple to install. If you look at a control like FreeTextBox it requires
      you to copy a single assembly to your /bin directory and to add two lines of code
      to your ASP.Net page. I wanted the same for Bloget. </li>
    <li>It should use plain text files to store data. Don't get me wrong, databases have
      their uses, but a single user Web log doesn't seem like one of those uses. SQL Server
      is expensive to own, setup and operate. If you are using an inexpensive hosting
      service, it generally doesn't provide SQL Server support or if offered, it's often
      at additional cost. Databases are almost always administered separately with another
      program also provided by the ISP. And backing up is a chore as well. Again, it just
      seemed like a lot of work for a something so simple. </li>
    <li>It had to have easy to use backup feature. </li>
    <li>It had to have many of the features of modern blogging software like categories
      (sometimes called tags), posting comments and of course RSS. However, I wasn't going
      to try to go feature for feature with the big boys. I wanted something useful and
      light. For instance, many blogs have a calendar which highlight the days that have
      postings. Is this really a useful item? &nbsp;</li>
    <li>It had to be fast. I know you hear this all the time. What I mean by fast is it
      has to be responsive. That means making intelligent use of caching &nbsp;and avoiding
      being stupid when possible. </li>
    <li>And most of all, it should just work. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a id="aboutbloget" />About Bloget</h2>
  <p>Bloget is a Web log (often referred to as just 'blog') control for
    use in ASP.Net 2.0 Web sites. Bloget is implemented as a control meaning you have
    to insert it into an ASP.Net 2.0 Web page in much the same way you insert other
    ASP.Net controls. This allows you to integrate your blog into your Web site rather
    than designing your Web site around the blog software.</p>
  <p>Bloget is a whimsical name which is designed to make you feel good about the product
    and inspire you to throw wads of money at the author (did it work?). </p>
  <h2><a id="aboutbos" />About Blue Onion Software</h2>
  <p>Blue Onion Software is a somewhat less whimsical name for a group of products I've
    written over time and which I give away for free including Calendar Gadget&reg;,
    FreeSnap&trade;, DeskDrive&trade;, Calendar (no I'm not repeating myself) and of
    course Bloget&trade;. In return, you the grateful user shower the author with money
    by clicking some of the advertisements on the <a href="http://blueonionsoftware.com">
      Blue Onion Software Web site</a> (Hint!) or by donating money. I do it for fun
    but every little bit does help. </p>
  <h2><a id="programrequirements" />Program Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>ASP.Net 2.0 (1.1 won't work, don't try, don't ask, don't say I didn't tell you)
    </li>
    <li>A willingness to forgive the author for blunders, missteps, omissions and sometimes
      just plain stupidity. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a id="installation" />Installation</h2>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
    Copy the Bloget.dll&nbsp; assembly to the /Bin folder of your ASP.Net 2.0 Web site.
    If you don't have a /Bin folder, simply create one. </p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
    If you site does not have one, create an /App_Data folder. Bloget requires read/write
    access to this folder.</p>
  <blockquote>Depending on your hosting environment this can be done in several ways.
    Many hosting providers provide a control panel where folder <span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12pt;
      font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';
      mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">permissions
    </span>can be set.
    If you have access to Windows security options on your host you can set up permissions
    so only IIS and ASP.NET processes have write access. On IIS 5.0 (Windows 2000) the
    account used to execute Web applications (IWAM_xxx or IUSR_xxx) needs read/write/modify
    permissions. The ASP.NET worker process, usually <strong>{machine name}\ASP.NET</strong>
    on IIS 5.0 (Windows 2000) or <strong>NETWORK SERVICE</strong> on IIS 6.0 (Windows
    2003) also needs read/write/modify permissions.</blockquote>
  <p><strong>Step 3:<br />
  </strong>Create or use an existing .aspx Web page and add the following two lines
    of code. </p>
  <p>The first line goes near the top of the page usually just under the Page directive.
  </p>
  <code>&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=&quot;bloget&quot; Namespace=&quot;BlueOnionSoftware&quot;
    Assembly=&quot;Bloget&quot;%&gt;</code> <p>And further down the page where you want
      the blog to appear:</p>
  <code>&lt;bloget:Bloget runat=&quot;server&quot; ID=&quot;bloget&quot; DataContext="~/App_Data/Bloget.xml"/&gt;</code>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong><br />
    Open the Web page in your browser and revel in the glory of your blog. Actually,
    you'll see a license agreement. Basically it says you're responsible for your own
    Web site and that you do not hold the author and Blue Onion Software liable for
    anything no matter how miserable things become for you. </p>
  <p>After you accept the license agreement you'll see your first posting. Well OK,
    it's my posting but it has some really useful stuff in it to help you start using
    your blog and it only begs for money a little at the end. </p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:<br />
  </strong>Proceed to the Administration Panel (hint, there's a link in the first posting).
    The default password is &quot;Bloget&quot; (pretty clever, eh?). At a minimum, you
    should change this password immediately. If not others, less friendly than I will
    plunder your blog and lay waste to it faster than a pizza delivery driver on a Friday
    night. </p>
  <p>It's worth taking the time to fill out the RSS section at this time since you'll
    more than likely want to produce an RSS feed for your site. The Title and Description
    appear in the RSS. The blog link is just that, the Web address of your blog. Again
    this only for the RSS feed. </p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong><br />
    Start posting! Returning to the posting in your blog, you'll see links for adding
    a new posting. Add a few test entries to get a feel for how the process works (you
    can remove them later). You can add additional controls, enable RSS, Pingbacks and
    MetaWeblog. See the related sections for more information.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7:<br />
  </strong>Think kind thoughts about the author. Feel an overwhelming urge to go to
    the <a href="http://blueonionsoftware.com">Blue Onion Software Web site</a> and
    click the advertisements. Notice the &quot;Donate&quot; button. Contribute $5 and
    enjoy the endorphin rush from a good deed done. </p>
  <!-- Using Bloget -->
  <h1><a id="usingbloget" />Using Bloget</h1>
  <h2><a id="overview" />Overview of a Blog</h2>
  <p>Most blogging engines today can be characterized as Web applications. You download,
    install and "your site" is up an running. This is a great approach if all you want
    is Blog and a few other pages. Bloget takes a different approach and is implemented
    as a control (actually a collection of controls). As such, you have to add it to
    an existing Web application structure. Like all design designs, this one has both
    strengths and weaknesses. On the plus side, you can plug Bloget into existing sites
    and have a fine degree of control over appearance and interaction. On the downside,
    you have to decide what that appearance will look like.</p>
  <p>One of the unique aspects of Bloget is that you can express an entire blog in a single file. The tag
    line <em>"One file, one binary, one blog"</em> expresses this intent. The <em>One file</em> is the ASPX
    page you intend to display your blog in. <em>One binary</em> refers to the one binary (Bloget.dll) you
    need to add to your Web application's /Bin directory. There are no complicated install routines, database
    setups or Web.config modifications required. Of course <em>"One blog"</em> refers to the blog you produce
    with Bloget.</p>
  <p>Because Bloget is so simple to install, it can be integrated into many places. Often, Bloget is used
    as a running descriptive log for build environments. As changes to the build configuration are made,
    the configuration manager can add blog entries describing the changes instead of circulating emails.
    Bloget can easily integrate into Web based systems like Cruise Control.</p>
    <p>Membership support is supplied by ASP.NET's membership services. This means you 
        can use existing ASP.NET 2.0 membership providers with Bloget. See Membership 
        Services for more details.</p>
  <p>RSS feeds are automatically available in Bloget. RSS feeds are 2.0 compliant. In addition, RSS feeds
    support templates so allowing you to control the appearance and content of feeds without the use of
    plugins like other blog engines sometime employ.</p>
  <p>Bloget blogs also support MetaWeblog API. This allows you to use offline blog authoring tools like
    Windows Live Writer and BlogJet.</p>
  <p>Bloget does not have user accounts (I'm reconsidering this one). It is not a multiple author blog (also
    on my list). This makes
    sense when you consider it's a "control" and not an application. That said, it is
    possible to have multiple blogs by simply replicating the blog structure described
    above and pointing to a different data file.</p>
  <h2><a id="bloget_control" />Bloget Control</h2>
  <p>The Bloget control is the most important control. It displays postings, indexes,
    allows editing, displays logs, etc. It's essentially an entire blogging system in
    a single control. It is controlled by using query parameters and can be extensively
    modified using templates.</p>
  <p>Bloget is controlled through CGI query parameters. The parameters are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>m = (Bloget mode)
    <dl>
      <dt>edit</dt><dd>Edit a single blog entry. If <strong>p</strong> is specified, the
        blog entry corresponding to the <strong>p</strong> ID is displayed for edit. If
        no <strong>p</strong> entry is specified, then a new entry is presented for edit.</dd>
      <dt>admin</dt><dd>Display the administration form. A password challenge is issued
        if you are not logged in.</dd><dt>index</dt><dd>Lists all entries in reverse chronological
          order. Can be controlled using the <strong>p</strong> and <strong>c</strong> parameters.</dd>
      <dt>drafts</dt><dd>Lists all blog entries marked as draft. A password challenge is
        issued if you are not logged in.</dd>
      <dt>licenseagreement</dt><dd>Displays the license agreement </dd>
      <dt>login</dt><dd>Displays the login form. </dd>
      <dt>logout</dt><dd>Logout current user.</dd>
      <dt>log</dt><dd>Display event log</dd>
      <dt>rss</dt><dd>Display rss feed. For feeds by category use c (example: mysite?m=rpc&amp;c=2).</dd>
      <dt>rpc</dt><dd>RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Service Url</dd>
      <dt>search</dt><dd>o is the query </dd>
    </dl>
    </li>
    <li>p = The ID of the post.</li>
    <li>s = The index of the first item to display. Used for paging with modes that list
      blog entries.</li>
    <li>c = The ID of the category to filter by. Categories (often referred to as Tags)
      are logical groupings of blog entries. They are defined by the blog author.</li>
    <li>o = Sort order - ASC or DESC (Log View only)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Parameters can be prefixed with a string value which is useful if should you have
    more than one Bloget control rendered on a page. It can be overridden using the
    <strong>Prefix</strong> property. For example:</p>
  <code>&lt;bloget:BlogetBlog runat=&quot;server&quot; DataContext="~/App_Data/Bloget.xml"
    Prefix=&quot;bloget&quot; /&gt;</code> <p>You can set the target link of the links
      in your blog by using the <strong>Url</strong> parameter. <strong>Url</strong> 
        overrides the link setting in the blog&#39;s settings.</p>
  <h3>Templates</h3>
  <p>Out of the box, Bloget provides a useable, if somewhat plain, blog. However, the
    appearance of Bloget can be customized through the use of templates. Templates are
    HTML elements that define the layout of a particular portion of Bloget. Here's an
    example:</p>
  <code>&lt;bloget:BlogetBlog runat=&quot;server&quot; ID=&quot;bloget&quot; DataContext="~/App_Data/Bloget.xml"&gt;<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp; &lt;ItemTemplate&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;%#Container.PostLink%&gt;&quot; style="font-size:x-large"&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;%#Container.PostTitle%&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;%#Container.PostCreated.ToString("r")%&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;div&gt;&lt;%#Container.PostDescription%&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;asp:HyperLink runat=&quot;server&quot; NavigateUrl=&quot;&lt;%#Container.PostEditLink%&gt;&quot;
    <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Text=&quot;edit&quot; Visible=&quot;&lt;%#Container.LoggedIn%&gt;&quot;/&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;asp:Literal runat=&quot;server&quot; Text=&quot; | &quot;
    Visible=&quot;&lt;%#Container.LoggedIn%&gt;&quot;/&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;%#Container.PostLink%&gt;&quot;&gt;comments
    (&lt;%#Container.PostCommentCount%&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &lt;/ItemTemplate&gt;<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp; &lt;ItemSeparatorTemplate&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &lt;/ItemSeparatorTemplate&gt;<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp; &lt;CommentHeaderTemplate&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold; letter-spacing:1em&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/p&gt;<br />

    &nbsp; &lt;/IndexTemplate&gt;<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp; &lt;IndexYearSeparatorTemplate&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p style=&quot;letter-spacing:1em; color:Gray; font-size:large;

    <br />
    &lt;/bloget:Bloget&gt;</code> <p>If you have used any of the ASP.NET server controls
      that supports templates like the GridView or DataList control, the above example
      should look familiar. (note to self, this section needs to be expanded greatly).

    <p>The Title control can be used to display the title of your blog. In its default
      configuration it places the title of the blog in an H1 element and the description
      in a paragraph element. It can be enhanced with a stylesheet or customized using
      a template. The Title is invoked as follows:</p>
  <p><code>&lt;bloget:BlogetTitle runat="server" ID="myId" DataContext="~/App_Data/Bloget.xml"&gt;</code>
    It can be customized using a template. For example:</p>
  <p><code>&lt;bloget:BlogetTitle runat="server" DataContext="~/App_Data/Blog/Bloget.xml"&gt;
    <br />
    &nbsp; &lt;HeaderTemplate&gt;<br />

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &lt;/HeaderTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;/bloget:BlogetTitle&gt;</code> Declarative syntax:</p>
  <p><code>&lt;bloget:BlogetTitle<br />

  <p></p>
<h2><a id="categories_control" />Categories Control</h2>
  <p>Bloget supports categories (sometimes called tags). You can associate one or more
    categories with any blog entry. The Category control lists all categories present
    in the blog and their respective entry counts. The Category control is invoked as
    follows:</p>
  <code>&lt;bloget:BlogetCategory runat="server" ID="myId" DataContext="~/App_Data/Bloget.xml"&gt;</code>
  <p>It can be customized using a template. For example:</p>
  <code>&lt;bloget:BlogetCategory runat="server" ID="blogetCategory" DataContext="~/App_Data/Bloget.xml"&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &lt;CategoryTemplate&gt;
    <br />

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;%#Container.CategoryName%&gt; (&lt;%#Container.CategoryCount%&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &lt;/CategoryTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;/bloget:BlogetCategory&gt;</code> <p>Declarative syntax:</p>
  <code>&lt;bloget:BlogetCategory<br />

    &nbsp; &lt;/CategoryTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;/bloget:BlogetCategory&gt;</code> <h2><a id="recent_posts" />Recent Posts Control</h2>
  <p>The recent posts control lists the most recent posts in the blog. It can be filtered
    by category. Here's an example:</p>
  <code>&lt;bloget:BlogetRecent runat="server" ID="myId" DataContext="~/App_Data/Bloget.xml"/&gt;</code>
  <p>It can be customized using the <strong>&lt;IndexTemplate&gt;</strong> template.</p>
  <h2><a id="archive_control" />Archive Control</h2>
  <p>The archive control displays a list of links by months that contain blog postings.
    The control display a month/year list but can be customized in a fashion similar
    to other Bloget controls using templates. Below is an example of customized archive
    control. The <strong>Length</strong> parameter limits the number of entries to display.</p>
  <code>&lt;bloget:BlogetArchive runat="server" DataContext="~/App_Data/Bloget.xml" Length="12"&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &lt;ArchiveTemplate&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;a href="&lt;%#Container.ArchiveLink%&gt;"&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;%#Container.ArchiveDate.ToString("Y")%&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &lt;/ArchiveTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;/bloget:BlogetArchive&gt;</code> <p>Declarative syntax:</p>
  <code>&lt;bloget:BlogetArchive<br />
    &nbsp; DataContext="string"<br />
    &nbsp; Prefix="string"<br />
    &nbsp; Url="string"<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp; &lt;ArchiveTemplate&gt;<br />

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;%#Container.ArchiveLink%&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &lt;/ArchiveTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;/bloget:BlogetArchive&gt;</code> <h2><a id="blogroll_control" />Blog Roll Control</h2><p>The Blog Roll control displays a list links to other resources you think you're readers
      might be interested in. The Blog Roll control takes a URI to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">
        OPML</a> file. OPML files are commonly used to export blog lists from news aggregators
      like Bloglines. The two URI types recognized by Blog Roll control are http:// and
      file://. Here's an example.</p>
  <p><code>&lt;bloget:BlogetBlogRoll runat="server" ID="blogroll" DataContext="~/App_Data/Blog/Bloget.xml"&nbsp;<br />
    &nbsp;Uri="http://www.bloglines.com/export?id=blueonionsoftware" /&gt;</code> Blog
    Roll will parse the OPML file at the given Uri and display it. It checks this address
    every 6 hours and updates the blog accordingly. Two other parameters can be added.
    <strong>Length</strong> controls the number of links to display. If you're like
    me, you probably read a large number of blogs. Displaying a hundred or more blogs
    may not be what you want. In conjunction with the Length parameter you can specify
    <strong>Random=true</strong> which will select a random links from the OPML file.</p>
  <p>Like all Bloget controls, customizations using templates are supported. Here's
    an example:</p>
  <p><code>&lt;bloget:BlogetBlogRoll runat="server" ID="blogroll" DataContext="~/App_Data/Blog/Bloget.xml"
    <br />
    &nbsp;Uri="http://www.bloglines.com/export?id=blueonionsoftware"&gt;

    <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Text="&lt;%#Container.BlogRollTitle%&gt;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &lt;/BlogRollTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;/bloget:BlogetBlogRoll&gt; </code>And finally, the declarative syntax:</p>
  <p><code>&lt;bloget:BlogetBlogRoll<br />
    &nbsp; DataContext="string"<br />
    &nbsp; Prefix="string"<br />
    &nbsp; Url="string"<br />
    <br />

  <h2><a id="Membership"></a>Membership Services</h2>
  <p>Membership services are configured and serviced using ASP.NET's membership 
      services. Membership services conduct authentication and authorization using a 
      provider model. The provider model allows for different backend's that supply 
      authentication, authorization and profile information. Out of the box, ASP.NET 
      supplies </p>
    <div class="introduction">
        <p>
            ASP.NET membership gives you a built-in way to validate and store user 
            credentials. ASP.NET membership therefore helps you manage user authentication 
            in your Web sites. You can use ASP.NET membership with ASP.NET Forms 
            authentication or with the ASP.NET login controls to create a complete system 
            for authenticating users.</p>
        <p>
            ASP.NET membership supports facilities for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                    Creating new users and passwords.
            </li>
            <li>
                    Storing membership information (user names, passwords, and supporting data) in 
                    Microsoft SQL Server, Active Directory, or an alternative data store.
            </li>
            <li>
                    Authenticating users who visit your site. You can authenticate users 
                    programmatically, or you can use the ASP.NET login controls to create a complete 
                    authentication system that requires little or no code.
            </li>
            <li>
                    Managing passwords, which includes creating, changing, and resetting them . 
                    Depending on membership options you choose, the membership system can also 
                    provide an automated password-reset system that takes a user-supplied question 
                    and response.
            </li>
            <li>Exposing a unique identification for authenticated users that you can use in 
                your own applications and that also integrates with the ASP.NET personalization 
                and role-management (authorization) systems.</li>
            <li>Specifying a custom membership provider, which allows you to substitute your own 
                code to manage membership and maintain membership data in a custom data store</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        You configure the membership system in your application's Web.config file. The 
        easiest way to configure and manage membership is with the Web Site 
        Administration Tool, which provides a wizard-based interface. As part of 
        membership configuration, you specify:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
            What membership provider to use. (This typically also specifies what database to 
            store membership information in.)
    </li>
    <li>
            Password options such as encryption and whether to support password recovery 
            based on a user-specific question.
    </li>
    <li>
            Users and passwords. If you are using the Web Site Administration Tool, you can 
            create and manage users directly. Otherwise, you must call membership functions 
            to create and manage users programmatically
    </li>
</ul>
    <p>Bloget also supplies an XML based provider model. The XML provider only uses files. Bloget&#39;s 
      membership provider is configured like any other membership provider in your application&#39;s 
      Web.config file. Bloget&#39;s membership provider is great for discount hosting services that don&#39;t 
      offer SQL or ActiveDirectory services.</p>
  <h2><a id="RSSFeeds"></a>RSS Feeds</h2>
  <p>Adding an RSS feed is simple and automatic.By default, the 10
    most recent blog entries are included in the feed. The number of entries can be
    adjusted using the <b>Admin</b> panel. You can produce feeds for categories
    using query parameters. For instance, to generate a feed for category 2: </p>
  <code>http://yoursite.com/Blog.aspx?m=rss&amp;c=2</code> Bloget produces valid RSS 2.0.<p>The content
    of an RSS feed can be enhanced using templates. This allows you to place additional content (like ads)
    for instance directly in
    feeds. Here's an example.</p>

  <p><code>      
  &lt;RssContentTemplate&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;
  &lt;%#Container.PostContent%&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;
  &lt;div&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.pheedo.com/click.phdo?x=62927&amp;u=&lt;%#Container.PostID%&gt;"&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;img src="http://www.pheedo.com/img.phdo?x=62927&amp;u=&lt;%#Container.PostID%&gt;"
    /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;
  &lt;/div&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;
  &lt;div&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp;
  powered by &lt;a href="http://blueonionsoftware.com/bloget.aspx"&gt;Bloget&lt;/a&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; - &lt;i&gt;"One File, One Binary,
  One Blog"&lt;/i&gt;<br />
    &nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br />
  &lt;/RssContentTemplate&gt;<br />
 </code>
</p>

  <h2><a id="rpc" />Remote Procedure Calls (MetaWeblog and Pingback)</h2>
  <p>Bloget supports the MetaWeblog and Pingback API's. These API's allow your blog
    controlled by sending XML-RPC commands. Many third-party tools and popular Web sites
    (like Digg) can interact with blogs that support these API's. The procedure for
    enabling RPC in bloget is similar to RSS example above. You will create a new Web
    page and with only the following two lines.</p>
  <code>http://yoursite.com/Blog.aspx?m=rpc</code>
  <p><a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">MetaWeblog</a> is a standard client-server
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" title="Application programming interface">
      application programming interface</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblog"
        title="Weblog">weblog</a> (blog) publishing. It is built on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC"
          title="XML-RPC">XML-RPC</a>. MetaWeblog API was designed to address limitations
    of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger.com" title="Blogger.com">Blogger</a>
    API.</p>
  <p>On the administration screen you will need to add several pieces of information
    to enable MetaWeblog services. They are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>RPC Service Url - This is the Url of the page that contains the BlogetRpc control.
      <span style="text-decoration: underline">The RPC Service Url is required if you intend
        to accept Pingbacks</span>. It's important that this address is complete and include
      the "http://" portion.</li>
    <li>Image Folder - The folder where you want images uploaded. This a the folder name
      on the server, not the Url. You should specify the address using virtual path syntax
      common in all ASP.NET controls. For example, if the folder on your server was /Images,
      you would enter "~/Images/".</li>
    <li>Image Url - This is the Url of image folder you just specified. It's important
      that this address is complete and include the "http://" portion.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Owing to the fact that Bloget is a user control the blog
    ID is always the same for these API's. It is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blog ID = 1</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The he password is unique and it is the same one that is used to access the Administration
    areas of your blog.</p>
  <p>The following MetaWeblog commands are supported:p>
  <ul>
    <li>metaWeblog.newPost</li>
    <li>metaWeblog.editPost</li>
    <li>metaWeblog.getPost</li>
    <li>metaWeblog.getCategories</li>
    <li>metaWeblog.getRecentPosts</li>
    <li>metaWeblog.newMediaObject</li>
    <li>blogger.deletePost</li>
    <li>blogger.getUsersBlogs</li>
    <li>blogger.getUserInfo</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Pingback is an automatic mechanism that enables authors to keep track of who is
    linking to, or referring to their articles. Pingbacks are automatic and require
    no user intervention when enabled. You can choose to display pingbacks in your blog.
    Pingbacks are also logged. There are two components to Pingbacks. When you post
    an article, Bloget will scan the article for links and attempt to "Ping" those links.
    The result of the ping attempt is logged.</p>
  <p>Pingbacks are listed in blog entry page under the comments section.</p>
  <p>Once you have updated these fields, you should be able to user third-party off
    line blogging tools like BlogJet and Windows Live Writer. To make using these features
    even easier, the blogging community has developed a standard API for detecting MetaWeblog
    enabled blogs called <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/tech/rsd.html">
      Really Simple Discoverability</a> (RSD). RSD is well, really simple to implement.</p>
  <p>In Bloget, the Administration panel has a checkbox for enabling RSD. Check it and
    Bloget does the rest.</p>
  <h2><a id="blogml" />BlogML</h2>
  <p><a href="http://blogml.com">BlogML</a> is an XML format for storing the entire
    content of a blog. You can use BlogML as a way to archive the contents of blogs
    or to act as a standard format for transferring content from one blog to another
    - this could include migrating a blog from one blogging engine to another. There
    are currently several blogging engines that provide support for BlogML including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Community Server</li>
    <li>Das Blog</li>
    <li>Subtext</li>
    <li>SingleUserBlog</li>
    <li>And of course - Bloget</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are also implementations that exist for converting Blogger content to BlogML.</p>
  <p>Navigate to the Administration screen. Near the bottom you'll find import and export
    controls. Exporting will produce an BlogML compliant XML file. If you have blogs
    elsewhere that support BlogML, export them and then import them to Bloget.</p>
  <h2><a id="comments" />Comments</h2>
  <p>Like most good blogging engines, you can allow users to leave comments on you postings.
    You can enable comments on a per posting basis or on globally. When enabled, postings
    will include an area near the bottom of the post where the user can submit his comment.
    Comments are a mixed blessing. On the good side, they allow interaction with your
    readers and can add value to your blog. On the bad side, there is comment spam.
    Comment spam usually does not pertain to your post but instead contains links and
    <span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman';
      mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;
      mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">advertisements </span>to other sites. Often these spam comments are inserted by other programs
    called robots or spam-bots.</p>
  <p>Bloget takes some basic measures to suppress these messages but is by no means
    bullet proof. In addition to turning-off comments, you can limit the number of comments
    per posting and the amount of time the posting will accept comments. Also you can
    easily delete comments by viewing the posting while logged-in. You'll see a delete
    button under each comment entry that allows you to quickly remove any offending
    comment.</p>
  <p>To further combat spam-bots, Bloget requires confirmation from the comment author.
    This requires Javascript to be enabled. Most spam-bots do not support Javascript
    and thus will fail to post a comment.</p>
  <p>Bloget also rejects comments that have hyperlinks in them.&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a id="logging" />Logging</h2>
  <p>Bloget logs significant events such as new postings, changes to administration
    settings, comments, pingbacks, etc. Log files are saved in <strong>"~/App_Data/yyyy-mm-dd.bloget.log"</strong>
    where "yyyy-mm-dd" is the date in sortable format. You can change the name and location
    where log files are saved by adding a entry to the <strong>&lt;appSettings&gt;</strong>
    section of your Web.Config file. This folder path must start with <strong>"~"</strong>
    or it will be rejected and files will go to the default location. Furthermore, the
    <strong>path must exist and be writable</strong> (Bloget will not automatically
    create the folder).</p>
  <code>&lt;add key="BlogetLogFolder" value="~/App_Data/Logs/" /&gt;</code> <p>All entries
    start with a 3 digit code indicating the category of the log message followed by
    the time, control ID and message. The category codes are as follows:</p>

  <h2><a id="dataformats" />Data Formats</h2>
  <p>Bloget uses a data provider type mechanism. Currently, the only data provider is an XML, file based 
    provider but if you look at the code I think you&#39;ll see that a data provider is a simple item to 
    implement. I chose to stick with an object model which will make things slighty more interesting for 
    anyone writing a database provider.</p>
  <p>In the XML data provider, all data in Bloget are stored in files using XML. The specifics of the formats
    are not all that interesting. How the files relate to each other is more important.
    The file specified in the Bloget <span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';
      mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';
      mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">declaration
    </span>is the main file and contains information
    that pertains to the entire blog. In addition, it contains an index of all the blog
    entries. Blog entries are identified by a computer generated number called a GUID
    (Global Unique Identifier). A GUID is a 128-bit integer (16 bytes) that can be used
    across all computers and networks wherever a unique identifier is required. Such
    an identifier has a very low probability of being duplicated.</p>
  <p>The Bloget index contains the title of the blog entry, the identifier (the GUID),
    the date it was created, the date it was last updated, and a list of category ID's.
    The actual blog entry and <span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';
      mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';
      mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">associated
    </span>comments are stored in a separate file. The
    name of the file is the blog entry identifier (again, the GUID), prefixed with the
    letter 'C'. It is stored in the same directory as the Bloget main file.</p>
  <p>You might ask yourself if a system like this is scalable. Honestly, I don't know. I found that scaling
    is as much trial and error as it is design (those of you who have done this know what I mean). Still,
    I do take some measures to make Bloget efficient. I routinely test Bloget with 10,000 blog postings
    to test response times and stability. On occasion, I've bumped this up to 100,000 postings. I would
    wager that most blogs have fewer postings than than my tests. Bloget takes full advantage of ASP.NET's
    caching facilities. If a posting is accessed frequently, it likely will be in the cache.</p>
  <p>Bloget also tries very hard not to corrupt files. All files are serialized in memory, reparsed to check
    validity and then committed to disk. Backup files are created of the previous version as further insurance.
    This works well for Blogs because most file operations are read. File writing is are less frequent.
    To date, I have not lost a single posting. Of course your milage may vary but consider I use this software
    every day for my own blog.</p>
