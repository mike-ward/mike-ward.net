One of my favorite all time web applications, [Logmein.com](http://www.logmein.com) allows you to remote into your desktop using only your browser. I've blogged about this tool in the [past](http://mike-ward.net/blog?p=c30e9d86-613c-4877-ac54-d5ee540348e9). It's absolutely fantastic. Mac users can now take advantage of this **free** service as well with [Logmein Free for Mac](https://secure.logmein.com/products/free/mac/Default.asp?lang=en). This just totally rocks.
