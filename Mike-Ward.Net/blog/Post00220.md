One of my favorite all time web applications, [Logmein.com](http://www.logmein.com) allows you to remote into your desktop using only your browser. I've blogged about this tool in the [past](/blog/post/2006/08/25/logmein-com-realiable-remote-access). It's absolutely fantastic. Mac users can now take advantage of this **free** service as well with [Logmein Free for Mac](https://secure.logmein.com/products/free/mac/Default.asp?lang=en). This just totally rocks.
