Release 0.5.1 notes:

  * Add sizing control to right side of program to allow sizing width. It’s only on the right side and it’s a small hit target. Trying to keep the window chrome down to a minimum. 
  * Sizing cursors remain (use to revert back to pointer) when actively sizing. 
  * Tooltips added to navigation icons. 
  * Fix sizing issue in sign-in panel. 
  * Fix sizing issue in settings panel.

If you’re using Windows 7 and the navigation icons appear as squares, you’ll need to uninstall the Segoe UI Symbol Font and reinstall using this patch: [Segoe UI Symbol Font](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2729094).
