AdSensor Update

AdSensor is a Windows 7 Sidebar gadget that tracks your AdSense earnings. This update fixes a few minor issues. 

The background colors can be changed using the mouse scroll-wheel. Actually, you could do it with the earlier version but it wasn’t documented. There’s a “Tip” in the settings dialog to remind you now.

I’ve also added a refresh button to the upper left corner of the gadget. The gadget updates every 15 minutes but if you’re impatient you can force an immediate update. Google appears to update their numbers about every 1/2 hour.
