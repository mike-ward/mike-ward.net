[NIST’s Plan for New Cryptographic Hash Functions](http://www.csrc.nist.gov/pki/HashWorkshop/index.html)   
Due to recent attacks on the SHA-1 hash function specified in FIPS 180-2 , Secure Hash Standard, NIST is initiating an effort to develop one or more additional hash algorithms through a public competition, similar to the development process for the [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES](http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/index2.html)). What I like about this process and the earlier AES effort, is that it is public and peered reviewed. Very important for something that will likely be used to protect your personal information (like your bank account).

[The Dilbert Blog: Atheists in Jail](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/01/atheists_in_jai.html)   
Have you ever wondered what percentage of prison inmates are atheists? It must be a lot, given that non-believers have no moral center and spend most of their days robbing, and killing, and sodomizing farm animals. That’s what you do when you have no morality.
