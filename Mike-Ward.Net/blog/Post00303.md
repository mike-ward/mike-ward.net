Well, my latest little [Vista gadget](/blog/post/2008/06/02/calculator-sidebar-gadget-released) has received two reviews so far. One guy hated it and gave me one star rating. Another guy loved it and gave me a 5 start rating. Hey, I'm at 3 stars! Pretty funny. The 5 star guy did leave a five star comment as well.

> This handy gadget was just the right size to fit in that little space left between all the other gadgets crammed onto one busy space [sidebar]. Fact is this is a simple, handy, quick-math tool that saves me from having to open the regular windows calc. Who needs buttons when it is all right on the keypad anyway? If you know how to use your keyboard and want to save space on your sidebar then get this gadget for you calculation needs.

I'm always impressed on how users write better commentary about my programs than I do. This comment captures the essence of why I wrote this gadget in the first place and does it in a way I could never duplicate. Thanks dude!
