tweetz &ndash; Direct Messages Broken
2011-07-01T01:35:10
Today, just before the holiday, twitter has enabled a new security feature (sigh). Third party applications like [tweetz](/tweetz) have to make an extra request and get approval to access Direct Messages.

> As of June 30th, Twitter is giving users more control over what information is shared with third-party applications:
> 
>   * Applications must specify whether or not they need to access your DMs. More information can be found [on our blog](http://blog.twitter.com/2011/05/mission-permission.html). 
>   * Apps that you use to access your Direct Messages need to ask for your permission to access your DMs. 
>   * Applications that do not need access to your Direct Messages will no longer have it. 
>   * Your apps will otherwise function as they normally do. 
>   * Your Direct Messages will still be accessible to you on Twitter.com.

I’m not sure what this means exactly. I’ll have to research it. In the meantime, looks like you’ll have to go to the Web site to see your DM’s. You can read more about it [here](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20169272-unable-to-access-direct-messages-dms-from-an-application).
