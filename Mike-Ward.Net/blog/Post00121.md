Testing with Post2Blog
2007-02-03T16:39:24
Every time I discover a new offline blog editor I of course have to test it with [Bloget™](http://www.blueonionsoftware.com/bloget). [Post2Blog](http://www.bytescout.com/post2blog.html) - a desktop blogging client for Windows. This is an example of quick snippet that inserts link to Post2Blog and text if you type "Post2Blog". To disable this quick snippet just remove it via "Tools" | "Manage Quick Snippets". This editor makes the mistake of many others and has way to many "dialogs". I hate things popping up. On the plus the live spell checker works well. ![:-)](http://picturelli.com/images/emo/smile_smile.gif) The snippet feature is interesting and could be useful. Seems to work well with Bloget’s implementation of MetaWeblog API although it did not detect the blog settings using Really Simple Discovery (RSD) which Bloget does support. Expensive and there are free alternatives that work just as well IMHO.
