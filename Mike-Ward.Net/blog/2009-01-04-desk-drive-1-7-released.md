![tinytags](/cdn/images/blog/DeskDrive1.7Released_BE05/tinytags.png) Just in time to welcome in the new year, [Desk Drive](/deskdrive) 1.7 adds three new translations and a cool little feature suggested by one of our users.

Version 1.7 adds additional information to the shortcut label of removable drives (i.e. USB sticks) indicating the total size and free space available on that drive. The example image below shows a 1GB flash drive with 500MB of free space.

Also, three new languages join this release thanks to friends in **Russia**, **Hungary** and **Poland**. That boosts the total number of supported languages to 18. 

The community support for Desk Drive has just been amazing. I may write the code, but the testing, features and language support come from you, the user.

So keep them cards and letters coming. No idea is too trivial that it wonâ€™t get consideration. Enjoy.
