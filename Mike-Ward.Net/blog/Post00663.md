Flex Jam with Adobe Evangelist James Ward

There’s still time to register for the [Flex Jam with Adobe Evangelist James Ward](http://riarockstars.com/2011/02/10/flex-jam-with-adobe-evangelist-james-ward/). I’m going and it’s going to be a great learning opportunity. You’ll be a better developer whether your focus is Adobe Flex or Silverlight.

> Join SRT Solutions as we host James Ward, Adobe Flex evangelist, from Tuesday, February 15 through Thursday February 17 for 3 interactive days of Flex (and AIR) development and exploration. Jams, pioneered by Bruce Eckel and modeled after sessions that bring musicians together to create something new and interesting, take learning beyond the lecture/lab process. The lecture/lab learning works best for groups where everyone is at the same level. By bringing together developers of varying skill levels with a technology, the Jam process allows everyone to work at their own level.
> 
> Experienced Flex developers: bring problems of your own to work on, with the guidance of James Ward.
> 
> New or limited experience Flex developers: bring examples of problems to try, or work on the examples provided.
> 
> Note that James will also be speaking at the Detroit Java User Group in the evening on Tuesday, February 15.
> 
> James Ward is a Technical Evangelist for Flex at Adobe and Adobe’s JCP representative to JSR 286, 299, and 301. Much like his love for climbing mountains he enjoys programming because it provides endless new discoveries, elegant workarounds, summits and valleys. His adventures in climbing have taken him many places. Likewise, technology has brought him many adventures, including: Pascal and Assembly back in the early 90′s; Perl, HTML, and JavaScript in the mid 90′s; then Java and many of it’s frameworks beginning in the late 90′s. Today he primarily uses Flex to build beautiful front-ends for Java based back-ends. Prior to Adobe, James built a rich marketing and customer service portal for Pillar Data Systems.

Registration includes continental breakfast and boxed lunch.
