Desk Drive 1.6.4 Released
2008-10-11T20:05:08
[Desk Drive](/deskdrive) 1.6.4 now comes in 32 bit and 64 bit versions. There were no code changes necessary for 64 bit support because Desk Drive is written in C#, however, a 64 bit installer is required to deliver it to 64 bit systems. It’s unfortunate that one installer can’t be distributed that detects both 32 and 64 bit systems and just does the right thing. Maybe with the introduction of [WiX](http://wix.sourceforge.net/) in the next version of [Visual Studio](http://robmensching.com/blog/archive/2007/11/26/Visual-Studio-ships-the-WiX-toolset.aspx) they’ll support this feature.

Also a Croatian translation was added to this version. That makes 13 languages that Desk Drive now supports. Keep those translations coming.

The next feature upgrade for Desk Drive will include options to specify folders in addition to the desktop where shortcuts will appear. Stayed tuned.
