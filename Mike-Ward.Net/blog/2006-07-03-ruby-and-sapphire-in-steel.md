Ruby and Sapphire in Steel
2006-07-03T00:33:41
Scott Hanselman's blog is one my favorites. He does a great job of condensing complex and interesting technologies into manageable chunks. The link below discusses Ruby and a very cool tool called [**Sapphire in Steel**](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/) that integrates Ruby into the Visual Studio 2005 IDE. I haven't tried it yet but of course I've downloaded on Scott's recommendation for later use. Below is a link to Scott's original blog entry. Enjoy!
