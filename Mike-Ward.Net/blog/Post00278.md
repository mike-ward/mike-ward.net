![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/BlueOnionSoftware/Blog/stopwatch2.png)The [Vista Stopwatch gadget I wrote about earlier](http://mike-ward.net/blog?p=0504105e-454a-49a8-9e9a-335c3dfcce08) has been updated with a new color scheme that is higher contrast. It's also vertically smaller to take up less space. Same easy functionality, just prettier. You can get it from the [downloads page](http://mike-ward.net/downloads).
