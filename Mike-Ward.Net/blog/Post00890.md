What's new:

Run on Windows Start – Saves you the trouble of adding the program to the start folder.

Size from all edges – Added sizing controls to all four edges. Sounds easy. Believe me, it's not.

Revised Translation Files – Made it easier. The first block in the locale file is setup for you to translate. Just change the country code as instructed and supply the new strings. No copying blocks of text required. Should cut down on copy/paste errors.

Barring any show stoppers I think this is it for version 1.0. I would like to to see some more translations for 1.0 however. 

Available on the [downloads page](/downloads).
