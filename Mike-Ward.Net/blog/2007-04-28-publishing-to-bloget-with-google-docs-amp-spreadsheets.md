I'm not sure how long this has been available but you can now post to your blog using [Google Docs & Spreadsheets](http://docs.google.com/). You can add your blog by clicking the Publish button. In the dialog your see a button labeled "Post to blog".

Settings support most major Web services like Blogger. There's also support for [MetaWeblog](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi) enabled blogs like [Bloget](/bloget) pictured below:

As a blog editor, Google Docs & Spreadsheets is a bit awkward. For instance, to add image from a Web source you have to edit the HTML directly. There is a function to insert pictures from your computer however. One advantage of using Google Docs & Spreadsheets is it does keep a revision history of your document which can sometimes be handy. Also missing are tools to insert tags or blog preview similar to [Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/). Until there are more blog friendly features I'd stick with a more dedicated blogging editor.

_Oops! Looks like there still some bugs to iron out. For some reason, Google Docs & Spreadsheets returns an error about an empty element when I tried try to publish this article. It does not appear to be a MetaWeblog API error but has something to do with the format of the document. I had to finish this post with Windows Live Writer._
