tweetz Update #13
2010-01-13T02:18:54
This version (1.5) marks the transition to using [OAuth](http://oauth.net) to access your account. This mostly changes how you login. I’ve detailed the procedure in a [previous post if you need a step by step guide](/blog/post/2010/01/10/tweetz-beta-oauth).

I’ve made a number a tweeks to the interface and the code, hopefully for the better. The bug where the gadget sometimes gets confused about what size it wants to be on startup has also been fixed.

Available on the [downloads page](/downloads).
