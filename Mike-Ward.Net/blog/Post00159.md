![Woman asleep with sleep mask](http://www.myotherdrive.com/public/blueonion/Blog/sleep-mask.jpg) I've always been fascianated with sleep. I'm not sure why, but its one of the few human behaviors that actually interests me. I remember discovering a book in the University of Michigan Graduate library on the -3 third level (the minus is not a mistake) called "Some must watch while others sleep". The author was the same person (his name escapes me) who coined the phrase "Rapid Eye Movement" commonly refered to as REM sleep. I was simply amazed at the accounts of sleep disorders and theories as to why we sleep. [Discover](http://www.discover.com) recently published an article called "[20 Things You Didn't Know About... Sleep](http://discovermagazine.com/2006/jul/20thingssleep)". One fact caught my attention:

> Dreaming is connected to bursts of electrical activity that blow through the brain stem every 90 minutes during REM sleep. Over a lifetime, an average person spends more than six years dreaming, clocking more than 136,000 [hours] in all.

Now that's some power napping.
