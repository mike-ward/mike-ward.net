2006-09-27T19:39:09
Looks like the VB team has been busy. This component allows you to print a windows form, clean and easy. C# programmers should not fret since this is .Net component, you can easily call it from an .Net compliant language. You can also print to a file which contains encapsulated postscript. From the [website](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/aa701261.aspx).

> In Visual Basic 6.0, you were able to create a very easy report for your users by simply printing the form. 
> 
> Now with the new PrintForm component you can once again lay out the Windows Form exactly as you want it and allow your users to print it as a quick report simply by calling the Print method on this new component.
