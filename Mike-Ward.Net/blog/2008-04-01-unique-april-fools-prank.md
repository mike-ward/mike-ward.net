Unique April Fool's Prank

You'll see a lot of [April Fools' Pranks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day) on the Web today. This _unique_ spokeshave however, strikes me as a bit more clever than most. This tool is suppose to aid in making tapered dowels. Like most good April Fools' pranks, it's almost believable.

Lee Valley is a purveyor of fine wood working tools and a place where I spend way to much money. It is also one of the best mail order businesses I have ever dealt with. The catalog is pretty to the point of being lustful (yeah, I'm a tool junkie). Great people and great products (no fooling!).
