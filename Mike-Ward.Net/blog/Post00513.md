Simply Weather Alerts

I’ve always been somewhat annoyed that weather alerts appear on a separate page in many weather sites. Isn’t an alert important enough to display on the same page as the rest of the weather? I don’t know, call me crazy but important information like a tornado warning might warrant a more prominent placement.

OK class, can anyone tell me what the weather alert in San Francisco is today? Hint, it’s in red.
