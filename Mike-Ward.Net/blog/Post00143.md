Site Redesign
2007-04-05T23:56:28
I've redesigned the site. The old one was a bit goofy and it jumped around a bit while rendering due to the use of the [Nifty Corners](http://http://www.html.it/articoli/nifty/index.html) script I used for making rounded boxes. This design is very light being mostly text with just a few graphics here and there. CSS is used to render layout without the use of tables. It should load very fast and render consistently across most modern browsers.

It's amazing how much time one can spend fiddling with CSS and design layouts. You just keep tweaking and adjusting and then thinking it looks great and then 5 minutes later thinking it sucks. It's maddening which is why I could never be site designer (besides the obvious lack of any artistic talent).</p><p>I'm still looking for logos if any one wants to donate one. I need a logo for Blue Onion Software, Bloget and Calendar Gadget. Any submissions are greatly appreciated.

Also, I would appreciate any comments on how I can improve the design.
