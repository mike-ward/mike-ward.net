[![codemash](/cdn/images/blog/AttendingCodeMash_9068/codemash_thumb.png)](/cdn/images/blog/AttendingCodeMash_9068/codemash.png) What is [CodeMash](http://codemash.org)?

> CodeMash is a unique event that will educate developers on current practices, methodologies, and technology trends in a variety of platforms and development languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby and PHP.

According to some, this is the must attend developer event of the year. I’ve never been so I can’t attest to this assertion but people I respect tell me it’s really worth attending. I’ll be attending all three days.
