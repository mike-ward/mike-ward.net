String.Format Tool in SilverLight

Can't remember how to format a date in universal time using String.Format()? How about scientific format for doubles? [This little SilverLight tool](http://blog.toolico.com/2008/developers-tools/string-format-made-simpl) helps you to quickly build a String.Format() call for any format-enabled type (int, double, DateTime, string) in .NET. Cool!

And if you don't have or like SilverLight, there's a [static page](http://idunno.org/archive/2004/14/01/122.aspx) with the same information.
