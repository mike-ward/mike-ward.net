What’s new:

Responsive Layout – A fancy way of saying that the elements arrange themselves differently when the gadget is sized wider. Looks a little nicer on the wider formats.

Default Theme is Light – This aligns better with twitter’s web site experience.

Bug Fixes – Nailed a few more those little gremlins.

Available on the [downloads page](http://mike-ward.net/downloads).

Hey! I need translations. It’s super easy and requires about 20 minutes of effort. See [http://mike-ward.net/tweetz](http://mike-ward.net/tweetz) for details.

Oh, and that other thing – Merry Christmas! (or X-Mas or Happy Holidays or whatever you’re suppose to call it these days)
