Dual Monitor Wallpaper
2007-11-05T14:59:49
I have dual 1600 x 1200 screens here at work and have been trying to find some high quality photographs that will span the two monitors. I favor nature and landscape scenes although other subject matters are welcome. Problem is, I just can't find anything out there. I see a lot of 1024 dual monitor stuff but they just doesn't look that good expanded. The other thing I've found annoying is that some sites say they have 1600x1200 but then make me go through every photo to find the ones in my preferred size. So dear reader, if you know of links that fit the criteria above, please send them along. Much appreciated.
