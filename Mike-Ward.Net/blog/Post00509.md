Tens of thousands of you have downloaded my [Simply Weather gadget](/gadgets). It’s time now for a the sequel, Simply Weather the web site.

[SimplyWeather.net](http://simplyweather.net/) gives you the current conditions and forecast in a simple, no-nonsense, easy to consume format. You’re in and out in seconds and no one gets hurt :).

Seriously, how many Weather web sites obscure the actual weather information to promote sponsors? It’s like “Mostly advertising with a chance of weather” (I made that up all on my own).

I’ll be adding more features in the coming weeks but Simply Weather will always be first and foremost about the weather.
