![image](/content/images/blog/InternetAccessDown_F467/image.png) Looks like our neighbor’s had an invisible fence put in today. Nice, but one unfortunate side-effect was that the installer cut **my** cable. [Miss Dig](http://www.missdig.net/) (the service to call to notify underground facilities of excavation) did a great job of marking their cables but neglected to mark ours. Comcast won’t be out until tomorrow morning. Good thing they’re neighbors we like. See you tomorrow (I hope).

Notable First: The MISS DIG System was the first statewide one-call center in the U.S.
