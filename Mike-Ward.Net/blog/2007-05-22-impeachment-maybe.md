Impeachment Maybe?

This poll from today's [MSNBC Live Vote](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10562904/) is very telling indeed.

What's interesting is the forcefulness of the question. It's not do you approve of the job the President is doing but should he be impeached. That's a much more polarizing question and yet 88% still say he should go. Maybe people don't understand what [impeachment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment) is. By this poll, Bush's popularity rating is 12% (if you include the _I don't knows_).
