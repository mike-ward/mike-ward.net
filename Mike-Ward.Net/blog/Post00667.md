Tweetz 3.1â€“Release Candidate 1
2011-03-02T00:19:43
Barring no bad bugs, this should be the release code for 3.1.

I had to make some changes to internal format that will break some of the language translations in the tweet time section. Please send me fixes if you can.

Running with the latest release version of jQuery (1.5.1).

Special thanks to [Kim Hansol](http://xenosium.com/) for helping me out with the layout and style sheets. The gadget should be much easier and consistent for designers to style.

Also, the usual bug fixes and a speed improvements.
