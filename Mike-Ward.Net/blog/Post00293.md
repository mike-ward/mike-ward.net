The folks over at [Freewaregenius](http://www.freewaregenius.com/2008/05/21/freesnap-maximize-window-edges-individually/) did a nice review of my FreeSnap program. 

> ... this is one situation where the adage "less is more" holds true and I prefer [FreeSnap](http://mike-ward.net/freesnap). A nice program overall.

Gosh, makes me feel all warm inside.
