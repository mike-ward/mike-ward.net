[Desk Drive](/deskdrive) 1.5.1 fixes two issues and introduces a new translation:

  * Icons are not always removed on program exit
  * Positional effect not centered on icon
  * French translation added

Thanks for the feedback. Also, I just received translations for Galician and Spanish. I'll try to roll these out in the next couple of days.
