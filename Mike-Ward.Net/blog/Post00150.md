PNGOUT Rocks

> **PNGOUT** is a free optimizer for [PNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG) images and is written by [Ken Silverman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Silverman). The compression is lossless, meaning that the resulting image will have exactly the same appearance as the source image. This program can often get higher compression than other optimizers by 5-10% [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNGOUT)

A few weeks back Scott Hanselman posted a [blog article](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AddingPNGOUTToTheExplorerRightClickContextMenu.aspx) about [PNGOUT](http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm#pngout). I finally got around to trying it and **Wow** does this thing work. It can sometime shrink PNG's by 50%. Scott published a registry file to add a right-click shortcut menu in Windows Explorer. I've found that PNGOUT also converts **JPG's** and **BMP's** to PNG's and shrinks them with even more stunning results. I've created a registry file that registers these extensions as well as PNG.
