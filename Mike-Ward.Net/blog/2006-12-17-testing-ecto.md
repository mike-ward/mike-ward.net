Testing Ecto

[Ecto](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/index.php) is an offline blggonig editor. Testing to see if it works with [Bloget](/bloget). Looks like it does. 

I'm nearing completion of Alpha 3 now. I've added MetaWeblog support including the newMediaObject Api which makes it very nice for uploading images. Mostly documentation work left. I'll have to back fill the online editor to support these features as well but it's nice to see that my MetaWeblog implementation is working for the most part. 

Once I wrap up Alpha 3 in the next couple days it's on to [Comment Api](http://wellformedweb.org/story/9), Timezones and [BlogML](http://codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=BlogML). It just keeps getting better.
