WebOS Roundup - 10 Online Operating Systems
2006-12-27T15:08:06
[WebOS’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webtop) (sometimes called Webtops) are online systems designed to resemble a standard PC desktop while making it accessible from anywhere in the world. These virtual desktops look and feel like a Windows desktop (or Linux or Mac) but work through a Web browser making any Web capable computer a portal to your applications and data. None of these systems are mature enough to replace your operating system just yet but they show promise.

[Big WebOS roundup - 10 online operating systems reviewed](http://franticindustries.com/blog/2006/12/21/big-webos-roundup-10-online-operating-systems-reviewed/) has a nice review of the 10 different WebOS’s that’s worth reading. To satisfy my own curiosity, I decided to give these services a spin for myself. While interesting, none of these systems are ready for commercial use (IMHO). To cut to the chase, the only two worth a look are Goowy and YouOS. Upate: A reader pointed out that DesktopTwo is working. The outage I experienced was temporary. It has since come back on line. After trying it I agree with the reader that it is indeed a solid product and worth consideration. I could see something like this working in a corporate environment. As for me, I’ll stick with my laptop for now.

Works, demo only. Nice feel and fast.

**Update: **A reader commented that he felt my assessment a bit hasty. When tried to login earlier, I got the message below. I went back and indeed, DesktopTwo is really quite good. Possibly better than the others. Thanks for the heads up!

“output=error&msg;=Could not connect to the database&” (Need I say more?)

[Eyeos](http://eyeos.org/)   
Worth a look. Still too early for practical use.

[Glide](http://www.glidedigital.com/)   
Free registration requires an SMS capable cell phone to receive the registration code. No thank you…

[Goowy](http://www.goowy.com/) ![](/cdn/images/blog/Blog/smile19.gif)  
Second best experience of the bunch. The best looking in my opinion. Keep an eye on this one.

[Orcaa](http://www.orcaa.com/)   
IE only (no Firefox support yet). Interesting concept but could not get it to work with IE7.

[Purefect](http://www.purefect.org/)   
Shows a lot of promise. Early stage of development. No real applications yet.

[SSOE](http://giffard.dynalias.net/ssoe/)   
Too early to tell. Huge icons. 

[Xindesk](http://www.xindesk.com/)   
Not available yet. Only screen shots  
Update: The author points out that there is a demo link on the blog page. Tried it. Very nice. Looks like it’s early in development which likely explains some of the slowness I experienced. Should be a contender.

[YouOS](https://www.youos.com/) ![](/cdn/images/blog/Blog/smile19.gif)  
Easily the best system going. I like the look of Goowy better but YouOS is further along in development. It has an editor and several Web browsers. Worth a look.
