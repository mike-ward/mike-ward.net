Why Does Vista Use All My Memory?

Jeff Atwood has been my blogging hero as of late. His latest blog entry "[Why Does Vista Use All My Memory?](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000688.html)" explains the new memory strategy that Windows Vista employs. In it he explains Vista's strategy of using all the memory in your system all the time. He compares it to cache memory and explains why it's good for the system to behave this way. I never thought about system memory as a cache before. Interesting idea.
