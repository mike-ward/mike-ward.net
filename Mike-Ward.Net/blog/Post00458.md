Simply Weather Gadget Updated

I started getting reports this morning that the weather icons were not showing in Simply Weather, my Windows Vista Sidebar gadget. Sure enough, when I got home I discovered that Google had changed the relative path to the weather icons. Why they didn’t notify me of this change is a mystery :).

Easy fix. Kind of annoying that they pulled the rug out from under me on this one. Last week it was the forecast data, this week icons, next week? If this keeps up I may have to consider a different weather service API.

As always, it’s available from the [downloads](http://mike-ward.net/downloads) page. The Live.com gallery will take a day or so to reflect the update. - Mike
