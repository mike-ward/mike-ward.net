Safari Web Inspector
2007-12-14T01:37:22
I seem to be using the [Windows beta of Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/) more and more. I can't say exactly why. Some how it just feels right to me. One thing I do miss is the excellent [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843) plug-in for [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/). But fret no more! There is something similar in Safari called [Web Inspector](http://webkit.org/blog/108/yet-another-one-more-thing-a-new-web-inspector/). It requires that you add a line to the preferences file to enable. [Instructions can be found here](http://trac.webkit.org/projects/webkit/wiki/Web%20Inspector#EnablingWebInspector).

The Web Inspector can be opened by **right clicking anywhere on a web page** and choosing **Inspect Element**. Once open, it highlights the node on the page as it is selected in the hierarchy. You can also search for nodes by node name, id and CSS class name.
