Tweetz 2.0 – Beta 3
2010-02-11T23:52:46
More changes based on feedback.

  * Auto-refresh – When the gadget is scrolled to the top, new tweets are automatically displayed. If you’re scrolled down, an orange number appears next to the title indicating the number of new tweets. Click the refresh button to get the new tweets (and go to the top). 
  * Duplicate tweets – Sometimes a tweet would appear twice. Should be fixed. 
  * Changed title font from Comic Sans to Tahoma 

Hopefully, this handles the “new tweet” behavior in a way that everyone can use.

What’s next? I think I’ll go after some low hanging fruit.

  * Font sizes: Thinking of 3 sizes. The current size plus one smaller and one bigger 
  * Font color: Probably a dull and normal (full white) 
  * There’s a minor bug in the reported time 
  * Follow/Unfollow 
  * Reformat retweets to look more like the web site 
  * Use new retweet Api
