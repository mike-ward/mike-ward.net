Ala Crate - Nice
2007-11-20T02:40:24
I'm starting a new category and calling it Naughty & Nice in honor of the season. I buy products online all the time and prefer it to shopping at retail stores. Of course, like all things in life, there are good vendors and bad vendors. I'm documenting my online buying experiences under this category in hopes it will help others. I do not get paid for these endorsements. I simply relate my experiences as I see them.  
  
And the first entry goes to [Ala Crate](http://http://alacrate.com). Ordered a Logitech V270 Bluetooth Mouse on Friday afternoon and it was in my hands Monday evening. Product shipped within hours of ordering and was sent priority mail with tracking number. Nice!

There online catalog leaves something to be desired but if you do find something you like, I expect you'll have it in short order.
