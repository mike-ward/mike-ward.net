[![Day of .Net October 20, 2007 - See You there!](http://www.dayofdotnet.org/images/DoDNBadge2Fall2007.png)](http://www.dayofdotnet.org)[Day of .NET](http://dayofdotnet.org) is a **FREE** .NET-only conference that is held annually in the Spring. Apparently it was so successful that it is being held biannually. I attended the event this Spring and was delighted at the quality of the content. It's sort of like a mini (very mini) PDC that Microsoft hosts every couple of years. The Ann Arbor fall event is scheduled for October 20th.

The event is free but requires advanced registration. Lunch is included and there often vendors there with freebies. The lecture format is similar to Microsoft events like the PDC or one of the Microsoft "Launch" events. One lecture I attended was all about Google API's and how to access them with .NET. Very cool that they are willing to talk about competitors. Take a friend and compare notes.
