Another discovery today. [ZOHO](http://zoho.com/) has a host of online tools for word processing, spreadsheets and presentations. They also have some other interesting tools like a planner, a CRM app, Online Polls and even an application creator. The site is super fast, even on my company's not so stellar Internet access. Most apps are free. Definitely worth a look.
