Standalone Windows Live Writer Installer
2008-03-04T22:41:23
For some reason I can not get Windows Live Writer to install on my computer using the integrated Live installer. It just gives me some meaningless error message and dies. What I needed was a standalone installer that didn't require an Internet connection to execute. Well, after much searching, I found links to standalone installers for all the Windows Live programs. Here they are:

I should note that these links are not official. Someone has downloaded and copied all the installers from the temporary folder that the integrated installer builds and uploaded them to a shared location. You should scan these files for viruses (as I did) before installing them.
