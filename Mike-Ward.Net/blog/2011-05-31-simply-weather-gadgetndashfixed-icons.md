Simply Weather Gadget&ndash;Fixed Icons

Last Thursday, Google changed the location and form of their weather icons. They also changed the feed which meant Simply Weather™ could no longer map weather icons to conditions. I issued a quick fix over the weekend since I was away.

It took a while, but I located the new list of icons Google issues and mapped them back to the old icons. If you update the gadget from this web site you’ll see the familiar, older style icons, which I think look better for the style of this gadget. I’ve also updated the Microsoft Gallery but it usually takes a day or two before updates become available.

Thanks to everyone for being patient. Let me know if I missed anything (or feature requests).
