My Favorite Chrome Extensions

If you’re not using [Google’s Chrome browser](http://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=C8hylS1JETbzjNsf3tgeAv-GdDammrvQBydHWohPXyIQGCAAQAVD6uKKjAWDJtseJkKToD6AB_fXI9gPIAQGqBBhP0IboooLn5hGcNm2pclDdSVPn0F5MoVK6BRMIz-34hfzfpgIVwb_lCh0HVTsDygUA&ei=S1JETY-cNcH_lgeHqu0Z&sig=AGiWqtzyvfzmHsCKNTxhU2-VoS_FVZ1kpw&adurl=http://www.google.com/chrome/%3Fbrand%3DCHMB%26utm_campaign%3Den%26utm_source%3Den-ha-na-us-sk%26utm_medium%3Dha), you might want to try it. Fast, minimal interface and compatible with the latest Web technologies (i.e. HTML5), it’s my favorite browser. Chrome also supports extensions. While not as numerous as Firefox’s extensions, it’s a healthy selection and getting better everyday (Sure wish Firebug would port it’s extension to Chrome). I’ve tried a lot of extensions. Many have been installed but few stay. Here are the ones that have made the cut.

[Google Mail Check Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gffjhibehnempbkeheiccaincokdjbfe) – I’ve tried a number of these notifiers. This one works the best and annoys the least.

[Incredible StartPage - Productive Start Page for Chrome!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ncdfeghkpohnalmpblddmnppfooljekh) – It doesn’t do anything I can’t live without but it is a pleasant alternative and does not seem to affect performance.

[InvisibleHand](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lghjfnfolmcikomdjmoiemllfnlmmoko) – Automatically get the lowest price on whatever you’re buying. Recently, I was about to buy a book on Amazon for ~$25. InvisibleHand notified me that I could the same book used for $8.95. Nice!

[SmoothScroll](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cccpiddacjljmfbbgeimpelpndgpoknn) - Scrolls the websites smoothly when scrolling with the mouse wheel or the keyboard. I’ve tried a number of these and most scroll too slowly or the smoothness is strange. This one gets it just right.

[Tabs to the front!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hjaooagfdhdhmbfchnkhggjmacjlacla) – Brings newly created tabs to the foreground. Nuff said.

[XML Tree](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gbammbheopgpmaagmckhpjbfgdfkpadb) - Displays XML data in a user friendly way. Oddly, Chrome requires an extension to do this.

[Tweet Button for Chrome (by Shareaholic)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/homldgnlpldcmdflhnabedgkgpmeanhd) – There are a number of these twitter plugins. This is the only one I’ve found that works without being annoying.

[RSS Subscription Extension (by Google)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd) – Adds one-click subscription to your toolbar. Again one those features I would expect to be built in. 

[iReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ppelffpjgkifjfgnbaaldcehkpajlmbc) - View news stories and other articles in a very easy to read, clutter-free, scrollable display. I don’t use it often but it’s sure nice to have when I need it.

[Facebook Photo Zoom](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elioihkkcdgakfbahdoddophfngopipi) – Does what it says. Works great.

So what are you’re favorites?
