I do it all the time and it annoys the hell out of me. So much so, that I started to write an application that would keep track of the last couple of folders accessed in Windows Explorer so I could quickly navigate back to them. It's not a trivial process to do this but I finally figured it out.

Just about the time I was ready to put together a redistributable I ran across [Folder View](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/05/19/folder-view-adds-recent-and-favorite-folders-to-windows-explorer/). Folder View is a freebie that hooks into Windows Explorer and adds an extra toolbar with shortcuts to common locations. However, in my mind, the most useful feature is the "recent folders" drop-down. Having the last dozen or so folders you visited is sure handy.

But then it goes one better and modifies the common open file dialogs to include the same items as the Windows Explorer toolbar. This makes adding attachments to messages easier. Highly recommended.
