The makers of [NOD32](http://www.eset.com), a powerful Antivirus progam I [wrote about earlier](http://mike-ward.net/blog?bloget_mode=View&bloget_item=dbc5f63a-a63c-4e69-ac08-db52fc5a7e7f), have a nifty little Web site called [Virus Radar On-Line](http://www.virus-radar.com). It shows the status of email viruses over specified periods. They list the relative threats and give an overall indicator as to the current risk.
