Any reader of this site soon discovers I like calendars. The corollary to this of course are clocks. [Poodwaddle.com](http://www.poodwaddle.com) offers a myriad of flash clocks you can run on any web site. The selection is extensive and inventive. My favorite is the [earth clock](http://www.poodwaddle.com/clocks3.htm).
