tweetz Update #9

User kimatg made some excellent suggestions some of which I’ve incorporated in this release.

  * Changed from Verdana to Segoe UI font. The new font is “just right”. I went through a lot of back and forth on fonts but never tried this one. I’m considering changing my other gadgets to use it.
  * The home page link on the user status page caused a fault when no home page was defined. Changed to hide the link when it’s not defined.
  * The code has been cleaned up using [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) which hunts down subtle issues and improves the code quality. A few of you have mentioned performance issues. Hopefully, this will clean it up.
  * The search page content was clipping the top of the navigation buttons.

That’s all for now. Keep the feedback coming and I’ll incorporate what I can.
