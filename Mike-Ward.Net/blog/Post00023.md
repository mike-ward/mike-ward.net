PimpFish - I'm not sure I get it
2006-08-31T14:50:35
Ran across this [site](http://pimpfish.com/) today. PimpFish is a browser add on that let's you quickly download most images, flash movies and other visual content with a click of a button. They also have a feature called Slap Files which are collections of stuff you've downloaded. You then share your Slap Files with your buddies (I'm not going to even go there). It integrates well and does what it says but I'm not sure I get it. Perhaps it's just another example of being over "40". Can some one enlighten me?
