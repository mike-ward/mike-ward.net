Yellowstone

We're headed out West next week for a long over due vacation. The plan is rent a pull-behind trailer and drive out to Yellowstone via the Bad Lands. I've spent a fair amount of time in Colorado and Arizona but never managed to find my way to Wyoming.

We're driving from Michigan across I-90 going out and I-80 coming back. So fellow readers, any tips or out of the way places you can recommend we visit? My 8 and 9 year old are pretty active so anything that "wears them out" is welcomed.
