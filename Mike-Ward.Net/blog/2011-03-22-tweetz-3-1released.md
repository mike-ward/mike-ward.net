Tweetz 3.1–Released
2011-03-22T00:15:57
Sound the trumpets (or kazoos), [Tweetz](/tweetz) 3.1 has shipped. I waited for IE9 to ship to make sure there were no compatibility issues (there were none). So what’s new?

Localized to 12 languages – Thanks to the efforts of some dedicated users, Tweetz is now available in 12 languages – German, Greek, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Latvian, Portuguese (Brazil), Swedish, Turkish and English.

  * Themes – Two new themes have been added. You can switch between them by pressing Ctrl-Q. 
  * Speed – Huge speed and memory usage improvements. 
  * New Icon Bar – Newer icons that scale better and look better. 
  * And a zillion little improvements and bug fixes. 

Localizing Tweetz is very simple. Edit the locale.js file in the gadget directory. I suspect it takes most translators less than 20 minutes to do this. When you get it the way you want, send it to me and I’ll include it in the next release.

Theming is also pretty easy. I had a lot of feed back from some designers on how to render the markup to make it “theme friendly”.

Thanks to everyone who helped. I’ll update the screen shots over the next couple of days.
