Some minor fixes I’ve accumulated over the last year. Perhaps the only one you’ll actually notice is a new icon for those rare times Google’s weather service fails to report a weather outlook for a particular day. Instead of a broken icon indicator you’ll get a “sunny” icon with a question mark overlaying it Just something to indicate that there was an error in the feed.
