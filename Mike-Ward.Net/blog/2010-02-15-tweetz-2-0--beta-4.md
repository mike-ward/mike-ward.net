Tweetz 2.0 – Beta 4
2010-02-15T02:03:56
This release adds some long asked for features. Now that I have a stable code base, I can start catching up on some of these requests.

  * Font Size – Pick from one of 3 sizes 
  * Font Brightness – Pick bright or normal 
  * Intervals – Set the number of minutes to poll for statuses, mentions and messages. 
  * In reply to – If the tweet is a reply, text and a link are added to tweet footer. Click the link to see the tweet that was replied to. 
  * Follow/Unfollow – The user dialog lets you follow or unfollow 

The settings dialog is a bit more verbose due to the new features.
