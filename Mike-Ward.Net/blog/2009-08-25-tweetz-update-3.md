tweetz Update #3
2009-08-25T01:33:12
Ok, I’m losing track of updates so I started numbering them. New changes include:

  * Favorites tab is active. It only updates when you click the tab. 
  * User page is active. Currently only for the logged in user but I’ll be following up shortly shortcuts to other users.

I also ran into an issue when I tried to retweet an update in that the [link] short cuts did not get expanded back to their original text before updating. That’s fixed now.

Available on the [downloads page](/downloads).
