VSColorOutput Version 1.3
2012-01-25T23:40:48
I was getting sporadic reports of 1.2 crashing. Finally ran down the cause. Initial feedback indicates that I have fixed it.

In addition to coloring build and debug output, VSColorOutput 1.3 adds these new features.

  * Stop Build on First Error – When enabled, the build will be canceled after the first error is detected. 
  * Show Elapsed Build Time – When enabled, writes the elapsed time to the output window after the build finishes. 
  * Show Debug Window on Debug – I run my debug output in a tabbed window. When I start a debugging session, Visual Studio switches to the last source file I was viewing instead of showing the output window. When enabled, this will pull the debug window to the front. 

VSColorOutput is free for personal and commercial use. It is also open source. Don't forget to [donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=5966770).
