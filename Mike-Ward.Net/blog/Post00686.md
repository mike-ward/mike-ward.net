tweetz 3.1 Update &ndash; HTTPS
2011-05-24T23:07:30
This is a beta release. It should address the problems reported with twitter accounts enabled to accept HTTPS only. It’s not that big of a change code-wise but considering the shift to HTTPS (the gadget always uses HTTPS now) I thought I would spin it as a beta to get some testing and feedback. You can download it [here](http://mike-ward.net/download.aspx?filename=downloads/tweetz31.beta.gadget).

If things don’t work out for you, you can fall back to the last stable release (3.1.5.0) from the [downloads page](http://mike-ward.net/downloads).

I’ve also updated the Dutch translation and added a new Finnish translation (Thanks everyone!).
