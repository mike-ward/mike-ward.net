Desk Drive 1.4 Released

Desk Drive continues to prove popular and lately I've been receiving an avalanche of suggestions. That's great and do keep them coming.

Version 1.4 introduces two new features: **Minimize all windows** and **Show locus effects**.

**Minimize all windows** should be obvious. When a new drive is detected, all windows on the desktop are minimized providing easy access to the new desktop shortcut.

**Show locus effects** displays a brief animation over the new shortcut helping you locate where it appears on the desktop quickly.

Also, I need translations for Desk Drive. It's as easy as editing a file in the distribution (DeskDrive.exe.xml) and sending it to me. So far I have German and Italian.
