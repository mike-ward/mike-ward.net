Tweetz 3.1 Update
2011-05-03T23:43:17
This update contains a fix for some issues with the Portuguese translation.

It’s easy to translate [tweetz](/tweetz) into almost any language. Tweetz supports most character sets and even right to left languages. 

First locate the **locale.js** file in the tweetz gadget folder (c:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Sidebar\Gadgets\tweetz3.gadget). Open in a text editor that supports UTF-8 character encoding (Notepad.exe works, don’t use Wordpad, Word or other word-processing software). Edit the file with your translations and save the file. Restart the gadget and check that everything looks OK.

When you’re satisfied with the results, send the new **locale.js** file to me ([mike@blueonionsoftware.com](mailto:mike@blueonionsoftware.com)) and I’ll add it to the next release of tweetz.

Available on the [downloads page](/downloads).
