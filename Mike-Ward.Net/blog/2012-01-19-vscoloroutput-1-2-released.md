VSColorOutput 1.2 Released
2012-01-19T22:32:50
Added new feature: Stop Build on First Error.

Visual Studio will continue to build the rest of the solution after it encounters an error. On larger solutions, this can be time consuming. VSColorOutput can stop the build after the first error is detected. To enable this feature, go to Tools | Options | VSColorOutput.
