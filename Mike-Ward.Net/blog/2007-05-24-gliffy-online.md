Here's a fun little find. [Gliffy](http://www.gliffy.com) is an only drawing program. It's very much like Visio but without the headaches. I always find myself a bit lost in Visio but with Gliffy I'm in productive and focuses. I think this is mostly because they make the easy stuff easy. Here's a drawing I did within 2 minutes of logging on for the first time.

Ok, I won't win any awards for this. The point here is that I'm drawing and posting quickly. In fact, because I've shared this document, others can edit it. Makes for some nice collaboration. The free version limits the number of documents you can store but for a measly $20/year you get unlimited use.
