Tweetz 3.1–Alpha 5
2010-12-16T00:49:12
I’ve been on vacation for the last couple of weeks and am just getting back into the coding thing. This will be the last alpha for version 3.1. Localization and theming have turned out to be a big chunk of work. I was going to add spellchecking and @name completion but it will have to wait for the next version.

The new popup menu seems to be working out well. The only menu item still not working is “delete”. I’ll have that working by beta. Also, I’ll do something with the “new tweet indicator” and get it working properly.

Whoever suggested using a single style sheet with a “docked” modifier deserves a big thank you. It should be much easier to develop custom themes now since you'll only have to deal with one CSS file.
