What is a Collection?

Mads Torgersen, a [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) product manager, posts an interesting [blog article](http://blogs.msdn.com/madst/archive/2006/10/10/What-is-a-collection_3F00_.aspx) about collections and initializers in the upcoming release of [C# 3.0](http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/0/9503e33e-fde6-4aed-b5d0-ffe749822f1b/csharp%25203.0%2520specification.doc&e=9797&sig=__FxSOmKY_Z4MustIx_fZADp2xvfE=). For instance, in C# 3.0 you can create and initialize a collection as follows:
    
    new myNames { "Mike", "Frank", "Sue");

Just how this works and some of the discoveries Microsoft made about their own code makes for a good read ([article](http://blogs.msdn.com/madst/archive/2006/10/10/What-is-a-collection_3F00_.aspx)).
