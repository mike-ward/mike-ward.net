IE8 and Session Cookies
2009-10-08T22:22:50
IE8 has this annoying habit on my wife’s computer of not working with some Web sites. Same computer, same Web site using Opera or Firefox works fine. She prefers IE8 so after a few moments of poking around I discovered that I had to enable session cookies. Here’s how:

Open the IE Options dialog, click on the privacy tab and then Advanced.

and then enable session cookies.

This cleared up the problems although I don’t know why. Maybe someone can explain what’s happening and what the risks are if any?
