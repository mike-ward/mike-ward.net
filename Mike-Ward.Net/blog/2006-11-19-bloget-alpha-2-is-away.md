Bloget Alpha 2 is ready for download. So what's new you ask? The two major new features of this release are Pingback support and logging.   
  
[Pingback](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback) is a popular protocol that enables authors keep track of who is linking to, or referring to their articles simply by referencing them in the blog article. Most popular Web log engines support it.  
  
Logging is less sexy but equally useful. Most actions are logged now to text files and include things like administrative changes, new posts, editing, comments and of course Pingbacks. Not very sexy but really useful.  
  
There were numerous little changes as well which will help with usability and long term maintenance of the program. Check the Changes.txt file in the distribution if you're interested. And as always, send feedback. It's the only way I know what you're thinking.

You can download it [here](/downloads).
