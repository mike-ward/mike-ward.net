Ann Arbor Nerd Lunch
2008-12-04T01:14:01
![Nerd eating lunch](/content/images/blog/AnnArborNerdLunch_11C81/image.png) A group of us here in Ann Arbor, MI are organizing a monthly nerd lunch. The goal is to get local software developers together to talk tech... or whatever you want. Our lunches will be extremely informal. Weâ€™re thinking the third Wednesday of the month might be a good time. In the meantime, please get the word out! Drum up interest... get the AANL buzz on. Tell your nerd friends.
