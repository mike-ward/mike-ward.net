Tweetz Desktop Update 0.6

Here's what's new in 0.6

  * Real time updates. Tweetz Desktop now uses Twitter's streaming API resulting in faster timeline updates. This also avoids some of the limitations of the REST API. 
  * Reply to all. If other users are specified in a tweet, reply will include them. This works similar to the Twitter's Web interface 
  * Update popup window styles

There's been a bit of consternation over the symbol fonts for Windows 7 users. In a nutshell the problem is the Segoe UI Symbol font in Windows 8 includes glyphs not available in Windows 7. This is unfortunate but won't change. I tried using the Font Awesome icon font but they simply are not as nice as the current set.

Some of you have told me you can download the Windows 8 font, install it on Windows 7 and resolve the issue. That's your call. For licensing reasons, I can't endorse it.

The bottom line is I won't be supporting Tweetz Desktop on Windows 7. You have the option of using the original gadget in Windows 7.

On another note, I've added a Disqus section to the bottom of the [Tweetz Desktop product page](/downloads). I've removed the Disqus section from the Downloads page. You can report any issues in the appropriate product page (or this post).

**Update:** Fixed an annoying problem with replies quoting the logged in user. Current version is 0.6.1.

Available on the [downloads page](/downloads).
