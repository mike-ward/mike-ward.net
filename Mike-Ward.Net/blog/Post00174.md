Bloget 0.8 Released
2007-06-03T19:09:33
Another, month, another alpha. Don't know if anyone has noticed by I've been hitting alpha releases at about one per month since October. [Blogetâ„¢](/bloget) 0.8 is here and it has some cool new features. 

![Bloget blue sphere](http://www.myotherdrive.com/public/blueonion/Blog/thumb_aqua-sphere.jpg)Perhaps the most useful new feature is the built-in search control. Searching is straightforward to add. Simply add a Bloget search control to your Web page and Bloget does the rest. Of course search results can be customized using templates so you can get just the look you want.

And speaking of customizations, you can now customize the content of your RSS feeds using ASP.NET's powerful template facility. Now you can insert custom content like advertisement scripts directly into your feeds.

Posts can now include related posts automatically. This is a powerful technique for making your site "sticky" by suggesting additional posts on your site related to the current content. Related posts are "weighted" giving preference to titles and categories so that the most relevant postings are displayed.

I've updated the examples and documentation as well so be sure to check them out.

Send feedback! - Mike
