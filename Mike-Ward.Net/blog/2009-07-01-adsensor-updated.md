AdSensor is a Windows Vista/Windows 7 Sidebar gadget that monitors your AdSense account. Now you can keep track of your Internet riches without logging into the AdSense Web page. You can read more about it [here](/blog/post/2009/04/27/adsensor-a-windows-sidebar-adsense-gadget-that-actually-works).

This update adds 4 new backgrounds that you can select using your mouse wheel. Changes in http requests should make it more robust. Enjoy.
