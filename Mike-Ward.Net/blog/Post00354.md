Andersen Windows - Nice

![Andersen logo](/content/images/blog/AndersenWindowsNice_720E/image.png) When we built out house 12 years ago we specified windows made by [Andersen](http://www.andersenwindows.com/). Turns out that was a good decision. Not only have they performed well, but they have stood by their warranty without hassle. 

Recently, one of the windows lost it's seal (they're double glazed) and would occasionally fog in during the cold winter months here in Michigan. One call to Anderson and they shipped a new one via FedEx a few days later. Given that the window is a casement type, it took little more than hour to replace it. Problem solved.

We maybe paid 10-15% more for our windows at the time but with the superior performance and great service, it's been well worth it.

P.S. I don't get paid or otherwise compensated for these comments.
