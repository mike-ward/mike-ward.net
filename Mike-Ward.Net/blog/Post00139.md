Technology blogger Amit Agarwal has posted the mysterious keyboard shortcut for deleting messages in Gmail:

> If you are reading a message in GMail, press the # key (Shift+3) and that message will instantly move to Trash. Alternatively, select one or more email messages in the GMail list view, press the same # hash key and all the selected GMail conversations will be deleted in one batch.
