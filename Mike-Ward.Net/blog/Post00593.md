The service [tweetz](http://mike-ward.net/tweetz) uses to do reverse lookups of shortened urls ([http://long.to](http://long.to)) has been abandoned as of today. This version is using a new service ([http://longurl.org](http://longurl.org)) to resolve reverse lookups of shortened urls.

Also, a user noticed that the hover effect was broken on screen names and other links. Looks like itâ€™s been that way for a while.

Available on the [downloads page](http://mike-ward.net/downloads).
