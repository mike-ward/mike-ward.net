I know, I'm an [OpenDNS](http://opendns.com) fanboy. It really is a great service.

First, you get to enjoy the brief, funny video Chris put together explaining the benefits of OpenDNS to his skeptical father. If you've ever done family tech support, you're going to recognize every step of the way. ;-)

Second, you can share the extra protection of OpenDNS with your friends and family, all via a simple email
