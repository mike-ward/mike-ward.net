Simply Weather Update

A couple of nice tweeks for this release. First, the layout has been improved to handle languages other than English better. Dutch turns out to be a challenging one to fit in Simply Weather’s small format. Here’s an example.

Check out the translation of “Humidity”. Also, the current conditions are sometimes long enough to wrap (otherwise it would over write the current temp).

I’ve also added a new “dark” background. Also, backgrounds can be changed using your mouse wheel. Don’t work if you can’t remember all this. The settings dialog has all the information you need.

The current temp in Celsius was missing the “degree” symbol (fixed). The weather images are cached locally in case Google changes the locations on me again. Enjoy.
