ASP.NET [AJAX](http://www.answers.com/topic/asp-net-ajax?method=26&initiator=answertip:more) has just been officially released. ASP.NET AJAX is a [free framework](http://ajax.asp.net/downloads/default.aspx?tabid=47) for quickly creating a new generation of more efficient, more interactive and highly-personalized Web experiences that work across all the most popular browsers.

There is a ton of high quality documentation which is always a given with Microsoft toolkits. The site also features [live previews](http://ajax.asp.net/ajaxtoolkit/) of the the toolkit controls. It's a great way to see some of the cool stuff things you can do with AJAX. The quality of the controls is a bit uneven however. Some controls are gorgeous while others are very basic. For instance the Animation control produces some great effects but the rounded corners control does not support anti-aliasing which makes for some poor looking rounded boxes.

I'm planning on using this toolkit in several projects and reporting on my experiences along the way. Stay tuned!
