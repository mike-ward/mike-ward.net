tweetz 3.1 Update
2011-06-14T00:58:20
A few weeks back I posted a fix for the HTTPS problems some of you encountered. I posted a beta then that addressed the problem. Haven’t had any complaints since then so I’m making it official. This new release is the same as the beta so there is no need to update if you downloaded the beta already.

[Tweetz](/tweetz) now uses HTTPS for all twitter activity regardless of your account settings. This mostly just means no one can eavesdrop on your conversation. It also insures that tweetz will work when your twitter account settings specify HTTPS only. Not sure how important that is on a public social network but twitter supports it so tweetz supports it as well.

And if you didn’t already know, you can set your account to HTTPS only on your twitter accounts page. Here’s a screen shot of what it looks like:
