[![US-175x100](/content/images/blog/Google_D650/US-175x100.png)](http://www.howtogomo.com/en/d/why-go-mo/)Not sure how long this has been around, but Google is promoting mobile sites by offering a free year of service from [http://dudamobile.com](http://dudamobile.com).

DudaMobile will convert your current web site into a mobile friendly version in real time. And it does a nice job of it at that. Check out [http://m.blueonionsoftware.com](http://m.blueonionsoftware.com).

It does a decent job of styling and laying out the site. There are dozens of site templates and you can control the content on every page if you're so inclined. It took all of 20 minutes for me to get my mobile site working. 

Better yet, this free account is a Premium Account so you get all the extra goodies like Google Analytics, Ad-Sense and lots of custom widgets. I'm impressed.

I've been putting off doing a mobile site for years because it's a lot of work to write and maintain. No more excuses now. And after a year, it's still only $108 per year. Worth it my book.
