I recently ordered some woodworking items form [Hartville Tool](http://hartvilletool.com) in Ohio. Hartville is a great source for all things woodworking. I ordered on Thursday afternoon and by Friday evening I had my stuff. Incredible! On occasion Hartville has extended special discounts to our local woodworking club ([www.semiww.org](http://www.semiww.org)). Great company.

P.S. I don't get paid or otherwise compensated for these comments. I'm just a guy who likes to buy stuff on the Internet and report my experiences.
