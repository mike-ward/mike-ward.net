C# 2.0 ?? Operator

I'm surprised how many of my colleagues don't know about this little operator. Termed the _null coalescing operator_, it returns the left hand operand if not null, else the right hand operand. It makes for handy shortcuts in code and I think actually improves the readability when used judiciously. Here's an example:
    
    Console.WriteLine(name ?? "Unspecified");  
    

Seems self-explanatory and it's fewer keystrokes to boot. It's also nice for lazy evaluation type statements:
    
    public User TheUser
    {
      get { return theUser ?? (theUser = new User()); }
    }

[Phil Haack postulates that this operator is thread safe](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=5&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhaacked.com%2Farchive%2F2006%2F08%2F08%2FIsTheNullCoalescingOperatorThreadSafe.aspx&ei=wxQWSOeBJ4_MefXlobcC&usg=AFQjCNGoBD7dEN4fvcXqszvh0neA0eyCZw&sig2=TaXdEgzoxe0F-8UtII_Y4w) based on an examination of IL. Don't know if that is true since I'm no IL expert either but since the left hand side is evaluated only once, there's a strong indication that it is.

There's also a [good article about the null coalescing operator at the Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/NullCoalescingOperator.aspx).

Finally, you can use ?? with value types in limited situations as described [here](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/07/TinyTrickForViewStateBackedProperties.aspx).
