Here's a neat little C# function for checking if one can convert a string value to a specific type.

Here are some examples:
    
    CanConvert("12", typeof(int)); // true
    CanConvert("f637a876-9d58-4229-9559-a5e42a95fdac ", typeof(Guid)); // true
    CanConvert("Backspace", typeof(System.ConsoleKey)); // true
    CanConvert("10px", typeof(System.Web.UI.WebControls.Unit)); // true
    CanConvert("red", typeof(System.Drawing.Color)); // true
