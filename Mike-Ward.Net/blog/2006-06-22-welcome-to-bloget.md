Welcome to Bloget

Success! Despite my best efforts, you've managed to get Bloget working. Here a few tips to help keep you going.

  * Backup regularly! Bloget writes to files, not a database so it should be relatively easy to backup. There is no built in data recovery. 
  * Use seperate directories. If you set your data file to **~/App_Data/Bloget.xml** consider placing it in a seperate directory like **~/App_Data/MyBlog/Bloget.xml**. Bloget saves each blog entry to a seperate file in the same directory as your data file. If you are planning on multiple blogs, this is a good way to keep things organized. 
  * The default navigation is as follows. Click on the title of the article to get a detailed view including comments. Click on the title again to edit the article itself. 
  * Download [ieSpell](http://www.iespell.com/) to add spell checking. 
  * Here are some links to your new blog: 
    * [Blog](Default.aspx)
    * [Properties](Default.aspx?mode=properites)
    * [Dispay this Blog Entry](Default.aspx?mode=item&item=f4b29768-cc40-4279-b3f6-9b0f50b79035)
    * [Edit this Blog Entry](Default.aspx?mode=edit&item=f4b29768-cc40-4279-b3f6-9b0f50b79035)
    * [RSS](Default.aspx?mode=rss)

Comments and feedback are always welcomed. Enjoy - Mike
