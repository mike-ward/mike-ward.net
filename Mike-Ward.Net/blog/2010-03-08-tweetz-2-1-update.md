Tweetz 2.1 Update

![image](http://az667460.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/images/blog/Tweetz2.1Update_10724/image.png) Now that the rewrite is done, I’m adding new stuff. It’s much easier to do so with the new code structure. Here’s what’s new in this release.

  * No focus tool tips – hover over a link and you’ll see the full link, or the the reverse lookup of the link if it can be found, regardless of whether the gadget has focus or not. I had to implement my own tooltips to do this. Hopefully, they’re not too ugly. 
  * Show links in post – By default, tweetz displays links as “[link]”. Since most links are shortened, seeing the actual link text has little meaning. The “[link]” notation uses less screen real-estate. Still, some have asked to see the actual link in the post, so now there’s an option to do just that. 
  * Notification of new versions – A surprising number of you asked to have the program notify you when newer versions of tweetz are available. Personally, I’ve always found these reminders annoying but hey, it’s a free country (or at least a free program). Checks for new versions are made every 24 hours if you choose to opt-in. 

There have been lots of other requests for features. I’ve kind of lost track of them. If I’ve left your request out it’s likely because I forgot, so don’t hesitate to remind me.
