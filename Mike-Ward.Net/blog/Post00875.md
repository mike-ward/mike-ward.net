This update does not add any new functionality. It’s a recompile to use the latest .NET 4.5 runtime. Normally, I wouldn’t bother but installing .NET 3.5 on Windows 7 and 8 turns out to be a real chore. The installer checks if the right version is installed and if not, directs you to a link where the .NET runtime can be easily installed ([http://smallestdotnet.com](http://smallestdotnet.com)).

That’s all for now.
