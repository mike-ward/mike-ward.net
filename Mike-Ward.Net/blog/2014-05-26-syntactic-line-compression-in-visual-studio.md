Syntactic Line Compression in Visual Studio
2014-05-26T14:12:44
The [Productivity Power Tools](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dbcb8670-889e-4a54-a226-a48a15e4cace?SRC=VSIDE) (PPT) extensions have never held much interest for me. I found that while much of it looks useful and interesting, I would quickly forget it was there and stop using it. Unlike [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), PPT doesn't nudge me into using it.

However, when PPT [recently announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2014/05/23/announcing-update-to-productivity-power-tools-2013.aspx) a new feature called, "Syntactic Line Compression", I had to have a look.

> Syntactic line compression enables you to make better use of your screenâ€™s vertical real-estate. It shrinks lines that contain neither letters nor numbers by 25% vertically, allowing more lines to be displayed in the editor. Other lines are not affected.

Syntactic Line Compression is a set and forget feature. It squeezes more lines onto the screen and does so in a way that does not distract, annoy or slow-down the IDE. I thought the different sized lines might be visually disruptive. To my surprise the changes were only subtly noticeable.

A small but welcome improvement.
