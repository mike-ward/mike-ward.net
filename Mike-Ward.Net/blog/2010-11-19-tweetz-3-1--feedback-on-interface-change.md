Tweetz 3.1 – Feedback on Interface Change
2010-11-19T15:09:07
I’m looking for a bit of feedback on a interface change I’m thinking about.

With the ever number of increasing actions available on a tweet, I’m thinking of using a popup menu to express tweet actions. At work I use Destroy Twitter because we’re restricted to using Windows XP. It’s not as nice as Tweetz (grin), but it has some great ideas (actually it’s a very good twitter client). Here’s a screen shot of the actions menu for a tweet (activated when you click on the gear icon).

Thoughts?
