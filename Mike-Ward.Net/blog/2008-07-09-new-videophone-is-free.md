_Here's the bottom line. If you have high-speed Internet access you can make unlimited local and long distance phone calls (to any phone, not just videophones) for 29.95/month. If the other party has a Videophone, you can see them. And the kicker, the equipment is **free**!

![](https://www.myacn.com/assets/digital/IRIS3000_StartScreen.jpg)ACN’s IRIS 3000™ is the very latest in video phone technology and combines the power of video with the expandability of a phone adapter, plus enhanced features not available on any other phone. 

This video phone essentially has a phone adapter built into the video phone allowing you to digitally-enable your entire household when used with a cordless base station and multiple cordless handsets. 

The IRIS 3000 offers a high resolution, 7-inch wide screen with high-quality picture. The screen tilts and swivels for greater flexibility and folds down flat, making it easy to take with you when traveling. 

Use the AV in/out jacks in the rear of the video phone to project the picture to a larger screen or monitor, and send the sound to external speakers to share your video conversation with a larger group. 

  * Stay in touch with friends through real-life video calls 
  * Enhanced Phonebook let’s you organize your contacts by name and photo 
  * As easy to use as a standard telephone 
**Easy Setup!**

Just connect the video phone to almost any broadband connection, plug in the power supply and turn on the phone. You'll be ready to make calls in minutes. View [FAQ section](https://www.myacn.com/digital/support_faq_requirements.html) for additional information regarding technical requirements.
