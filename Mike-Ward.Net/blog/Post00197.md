Laptop Keyboard Issue

I mentioned in an [earlier post](http://mike-ward.net/blog?p=e0b304b6-dda2-4627-bea4-2c5dbc719736) that the new laptop I purchased has the FN and CTRL keys in the wrong position (IMHO). The CTRL key should be the left most key. I thought after a week or so I would get use to the new layout, but alas it is just not working out. The Left CTRL key is just to far right to be of any real use.

I can not find a program that will reverse these two keys. I suspect a driver level solution is the only work around but I can't find one. But all is not lost. See that big fat Caps Lock key? Turns out there is a program available called [Ctrl2Cap](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Miscellaneous/Ctrl2Cap.mspx). It's written by Mark Russinovich of SysInternals fame. It converts the Caps Lock key to a CTRL key. Still not as convenient as the correct location but I'm finding it far easier to adjust to.
