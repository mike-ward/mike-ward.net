I love chocolate. I also feel guilty sometimes because I perceive it as unhealthy. Well bucko, this site dispels some of those myths about about the dark side. According to [AllChocalate.com](http://allchocolate.com) chocolate has about as much caffeine per serving as a cup of decaf, doesn't cause acne, hyperactivity, migraines, tooth decay or addiction. He even makes you attractive! (Ok, I threw that one in).

There's a great video on [tempering chocolate](http://allchocolate.com/professionals/tempering/) that my daughter and I intend to try this weekend and even which chocolates go with which brandy (some one pinch me please!). Ok so maybe I do have an addiction but really if you like chocolate you owe it to yourself to visit this site.
