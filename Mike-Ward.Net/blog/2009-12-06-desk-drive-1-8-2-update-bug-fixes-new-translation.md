Desk Drive 1.8.2 Update, Bug Fixes, New Translation
2009-12-06T15:33:50
I’ve had sporadic reports about [Desk Drive](/deskdrive) crashing when removing flash drives. With a help of few users, I think I’ve fixed this little gremlin at last. May it rest in peace.

The default settings exclude the A:\ drive now. This change will only affect new installs. There are some older systems out there that have floppy drives that spin up whenever Desk Drive checks the state of the drive. I still get a surprising number of emails about this. Old hardware never dies or at least dies slowly. I shouldn't complain. I still have a desktop system here at home in service with a manufacture date of November 1998.

Desk Drive is now localized in Vietnamese. That’s 21 languages and growing. It’s super easy to translate Desk Drive to a new language. Just open DeskDrive.exe.xml in Notepad (don’t use Wordpad, Word or other word processors because they add extra, private character sequences that Desk Drive won’t understand) and edit the default language as appropriate. Then restart the program. Once you get things looking the way you want, send me the file and I’ll add it to the next release.
