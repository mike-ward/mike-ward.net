Did you know... use Ctrl+Tab to bring up the IDE Navigator to get a bird's eye view and navigation of all open files and tool windows in Visual Studio?

Sara Ford's blog always has great tips about using the Visual Studio IDE but [this particular tip just rocks](http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/archive/2008/01/04/did-you-know-use-ctrl-tab-to-bring-up-the-ide-navigator-to-get-a-bird-s-eye-view-and-navigation-of-all-open-files-and-tool-windows-in-visual-studio.aspx) ! And as well as this works in VS 2005, VS 2008 does it one better with a preview window.Way to go Sara!
