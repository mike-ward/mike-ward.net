Simply Weather Feed has Changed (Again)

Sigh, Google has changed the feed again with regard to the icons. I’ll post an update tonight to resolve the issue. Not sure what the issue is all the feed changes are lately. Probably some “new guy” trying to make things better.

Sorry I can’t fix it sooner than tonight. My employer prefers I work on their issues, not mine :).
