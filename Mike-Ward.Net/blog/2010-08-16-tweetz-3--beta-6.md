Tweetz 3 – Beta 6
2010-08-16T22:38:15
We’re closing in on feature parity with version 2.3 with this release.

  * More links added to Home, Mentions, Messages and Search timelines
  * Restyled user status flyout
  * Added “in reply to” by flyout
  * Added option to use “Old school retweets”
  * Added option to “Show links in post”
  * Fix #tag searches
  * Translate bare “WWW” urls to links

I’m closing in for the kill now. The only thing I have left on my to do list for this release is indicating which time lines have new posts. I’ve re-purposed the tab icon to indicate current tab. I’m thinking of modifying the hover state images with some indicator (maybe an orange dot in the corner?).

And the future? Here’s my list so far. Vote for you favorites.

  * consider new tweet notification like chrome bird
  * consider unread tweet hover like chrome bird
  * Localize
  * Popup send to list like Destroy Twitter
  * Spell checker
  * Geolocation
  * Switch tabs using left/right arrows
  * More keyboard shortcuts
  * twittpic integration
  * Search near you
  * Delete tweets
  * Growler integration

That’s all for now.
