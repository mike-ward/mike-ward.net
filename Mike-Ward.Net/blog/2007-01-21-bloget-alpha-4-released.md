Bloget Alpha 4 Released
2007-01-21T23:33:07
![](/content/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/BlogetAlpha4Released_C67C/dork%5B5%5D.png) Bloget, alpha 4 is out the door! Some of the changes include:

  * An integrated log viewer 
  * Enclosures 
  * Upload Images 
  * Upload Attachments 
  * RSS Channel Images 
  * RSS Footers 
  * Additional template methods 
  * Really Simple Discovery 
  * SMTP Authorization 
  * The usual bug fixes and cleanups

Alpha 5 is already being developed by our crack team here at Blue Onion Software (namely me and my cat Euclid). We're looking at adding [BlogML](http://BlogML.com) and time zones to the next release. Look for it next month.

Bloget is rapidly maturing. It's proven to be very reliable in my use (classic developer comment - works on my machine). Check out the [documentation](/Bloget/BlogetUserGuide.html) and give it [try](/downloads). As always, send feedback!
