tweetz Update #6
2009-09-15T23:50:20
I’ve received feedback about the icons being a bit to colorful. I’ve converted most of them to monochrome, which tones them down.

Several of you have also told me that using “Enter” key to send tweets makes it a bit too easy to accidentally send a tweet before you’re done editing. I’ve removed the “Enter” key logic and replaced it with a “Send” button. You can tab to the button or click it with the mouse.

I’ve made several small layout tweeks like adding a few more pixels between the author’s name and update content. Also, the author’s font is slightly larger to set it apart from the update.
