The [Vista Stopwatch gadget I wrote about earlier](/blog/post/2008/04/13/vista-sidebar-stopwatch-gadget) has been updated with a new color scheme that is higher contrast. It's also vertically smaller to take up less space. Same easy functionality, just prettier. You can get it from the [downloads page](/downloads).
