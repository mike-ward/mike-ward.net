[Desk Drive](/deskdrive) 1.6.6 adds language support for Dutch (Netherlands). The Dutch (Belgium) release a few days ago proved to be quite popular. The Netherlands may be small but they sure are mighty when it comes to downloading Desk Drive.

Iâ€™ve also enlarged the dialog slightly to accommodate the longer strings that the Dutch translations introduced. Also, desktops and laptop systems have different resolutions that require padding the dialogs with a bit more whitespace. Enjoy!
