msdnReader Rivals Printed Format
2008-02-27T00:47:50
[msdnReader](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/msdnreader) is a desktop application that is similar to the highly regarded [New York Times Reader](http://windowsclient.net/wpf/starter-kits/sce.aspx). The application provides caching and offline reading of [MSDN Magazine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/) articles through a highly intuitive and slick interface. In use it is much more comfortable to read than the MSDN Web site and even rivals the printed format in layout and ease of use.

I found that the program works well in Vista and Windows XP. However, there appears to be no proxy support at the moment which is an unfortunate omission since it essentially eliminates using it in a corporate environment. The author promises to fix this issue soon. That would be great because I have a stack of MSDN magazines in my cube at work that I would like to dump. This reader essentially makes those hard copies obsolete.
