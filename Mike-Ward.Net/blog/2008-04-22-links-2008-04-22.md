[WIX](http://www.wix.com/) - Design flash web sites with drag and drop ease. A little too cute for my tastes but some of the templates do look cool. Currently in beta by invite only. Applied and was accepted in about two days.

[Open ID](http://openid.net) - OpenID is a free and easy way to use a single digital identity across the Internet. You can host it yourself or use a provider. I used [Verisign's PIP](http://pip.verisignlabs.com) service because I'm thinking Verisign will be around for a while.

[twitterfeed](http://twitterfeed.com) - Update twitter with entries from your blog. Requires an Open ID to login.

[Redmond Path](http://redmondlab.googlepages.com/path) - Joy, joy, joy! Makes editing your system and user paths a breeze. Free, stand alone program. Highly recommended.

[Jing Project](http://www.jingproject.com/) - The concept of Jing is the always-ready program that instantly captures and shares images and videoâ€¦from your computer to anywhere. Produced by TechSmith (Camtasia, SnagIt, etc.), it's a slick well packaged program that makes screen recording effortless.
