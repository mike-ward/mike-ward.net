[Adventures in MVVM – Generalized Command Behavior Attachments ](http://geekswithblogs.net/HouseOfBilz/archive/2009/08/21/adventures-in-mvvm-ndash-generalized-command-behavior-attachments.aspx)- There are several examples on the web that describe the [“Attached Behavior”](http://houseofbilz.com/archive/2009/05/29/adventures-in-mvvm-ndash-commanding-with-list-boxes.aspx) pattern in Silverlight and WPF. This pattern works really well for binding commands in the ViewModel to controls in the View. The problem with this is that for every behavior, there is a LOT of boilerplate code that goes along with it. Because the DepencencyProperties need to be static, they cannot be easily abstracted into a common class.

I suspect this topic may interest (and even shock) some folks, so I thought I'd share the rationale with you here.

[TestDriven.Net 2.23 Beta – Faster! - TestDriven.NET by Jamie Cansdale ](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2009/08/14/testdriven-net-2-23-beta-faster.aspx)- If you’re using TestDriven.Net 2.23 on a 64-bit OS, you should find that running tests is almost twice as fast!

[NCover - NCover Blog - Code Coverage for .NET Developers ](http://www.ncover.com/blog/2009/08/12/ncover-v32-released)- Great new features to NCover and a ton of improvements and bug fixes that make NCover Explorer simpler to use and easier to configure.
