Working with BlogJet
2006-12-10T15:10:18
Ok, now I’m trying [BlogJet](http://blogjet.com/). Easy install and seems to support my implementation of metaWeblog. It had a little trouble with the metaWeblog.getCategories call I complained about earlier. It complained about a bad value but then later on, it seem to work just fine. Go figure. One disappointment right out gates is that it does not spell check as you type. Heck, even the Firefox browser does that. Oh, well, at least I can post for now. I’ll have to test image uploads later.
