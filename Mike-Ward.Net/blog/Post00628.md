Market Report and Stopwatch Gadgets Updated

I had some extra time this weekend to spruce up a couple of my other sidebar gadgets.

Market Report was updated last week to work with Google’s API since Yahoo no longer supports the Dow Jones Industrials index. I noticed a few other issues this week, mostly internal, and decided to do a little house keeping code-wise. I’ve also added a tool-tip to the gadget reminding you that background colors can be changed using the mouse wheel.

Stopwatch gets some similar code cleanups. I’ve also added a limit (10) on the number of times the gadget will beep on timer expiration so it doesn’t annoy others if you’re away from your computer. The gadget still continues to blink on timer expiration until you click it.
