Tweetz Update – Version 2.3
2010-04-18T23:18:46
The pace of updates for [tweetz](/tweetz) is slowing down in part to other obligations. With that aside, this release implements one of the most asked for features, indication of new tweets.

New tweets are displayed with a different background color. You can mark the tweet as unread by clicking on it. Ctrl+click will mark all items as unread.

The choice of changing the background color is mostly because it was the path of least resistance. If you have another idea on how to indicate new (unread) tweets, I’m interested in hearing it.

That’s about all for now. - Mike
