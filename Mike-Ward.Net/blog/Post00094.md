Bloget Alpha 3 is Away
2006-12-23T01:23:30
[Bloget](http://mike-ward.net/bloget) Version 0.3 is just in time for the Holidays. This release implements the [MetaWeblog Api](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi) including image uploads. It works great with many off line editors like [BlogJet](http://blogjet.com/) and [Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!174.entry) as well as blogging services like [Blogmailr](http://www.blogmailr.com/). Along the way there have been many _little_ changes that don’t seem like much but really add to the overall feel of the project. Of course being only Alpha 3 there’s lots left to do.

In Alpha 4 the Web editor will get some attention. It needs to catch up with the off line editors and allow image uploads, enclosures and file uploads. I’ll also add trackback support.

In Alpha 5, I’m also hoping to add [BlogML](http://codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=BlogML) support so content can be imported and exported easily into Bloget.

Looking down the road a bit further, Alpha 6 should have time zones, blacklists and better comment and trackback moderation.

The one thing I could really use right now is a logo for Bloget. If you have a way with photoshop and have a few minutes why not create a logo or two. I’ll post all submissions. Any help is appreciated. ![](http://mike-ward.net/content/images/blog/Blog/smile19.gif)

And don’t forget to write! Feedback, good or bad really helps me to know if I’m hitting the mark or not plus I’m just curious how the project is being used. – Mike
