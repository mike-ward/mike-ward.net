As much as I like FireFox and Safari for Windows there are times when only Internet Explorer will do. This is often the case in corporations where you are either restricted to using IE or there are IT applications that will only run in IE. Personally, I find the IE6/IE7 interfaces annoying to use. Apparently I'm not the only one who feels this way. There are dozens of alternative browsers that use the IE rendering engine with enhanced interfaces.  
  
![](http://www.ioage.com/en/images/box.gif)Most of these alternative IE browsers tend to be a bit too busy for my tastes. One notable exception is [The World Browser](http://www.ioage.com/en/index.htm). It's lightweight and makes using IE noticably easier. The skin support allows you to change the look and feel. I particularly like the Safari skin, which is small, quiet and highly usable. Other features include intelligent advertisement/pop-up blocking and better security.  
  
So if you're stuck using IE, due yourself a favor and check out this free alternative. It makes IE feel like a real browser.
