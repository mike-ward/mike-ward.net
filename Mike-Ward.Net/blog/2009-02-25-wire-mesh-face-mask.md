Wire Mesh Face Mask

Woodworking requires good tools and I’m always looking for a new “shop-aid” to feed my gadget habit. I bought one of these wire mesh face masks a while back and find I use it often.

I put it on and sometimes find a few minutes later that I’ve forgotten to take it off. It's lighter than other shields. If you wear glasses, this is a really nice alternative to goggles. Never fogs, even in my sometimes very cold garage. And you don’t get the “space helmet” feeling full plastic masks can create.

Available from Garrett Wade, they also get a “Nice” rating. Prompt delivery and great products.
