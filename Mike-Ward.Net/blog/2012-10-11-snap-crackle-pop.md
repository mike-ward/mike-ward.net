[![knockout-punch](/cdn/images/blog/Snap-Crackle-Pop_729C/knockout-punch_thumb.jpg)](/cdn/images/blog/Snap-Crackle-Pop_729C/knockout-punch.jpg)Twitter has started phasing out its Version 1.0 REST API’s as of yesterday. As a result Tweetz, my twitter desktop gadget, stopped working. I’ve posted a very quick patch to get the timelines working again. However, posting new tweets is broken. That’s going to take more work.

In a rather unfortunate bit of timing, I’ve migrated all my machines over to Windows 8, so fixing gadgets is much harder now. Longer term, I’m moving the gadgets to native desktop windows applications. I’ve started on a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) version of tweetz. It will look and behave (for the most part) like the gadget. It will lose some of the gadget functionality I really like (aero peek for instance). Such is the price of “Progress”.
