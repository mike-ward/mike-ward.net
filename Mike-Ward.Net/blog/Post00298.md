Desk Drive Memory Reduced?

I'm not sure why but Version 1.1 of Desk Drive uses 5 MB as compared to 18 MB for Version 1.0.

Maybe it's the new compiler in Visual Studio 2008? The code hardly changed between version 1.0 and 1.1 so I'm a bit perplexed because similar programs I've written use 9 - 12 MB. Will wonders never cease? The memory column is the number of private bytes which is a more accurate measure of what the program is really using. I have not checked this on XP so YMMV. Appreciate any reports.
