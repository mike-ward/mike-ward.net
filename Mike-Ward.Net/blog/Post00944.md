Tweetz Desktop Update - 0.8.22
2014-08-30T14:23:02
Been a while since I updated [Tweetz](/tweetz) Desktop. Busy busy busy as they say. So what's new?

  * Romanian, Japanese, Russian and Ukrainian translations added 
  * Monetization removed 
  * Expiration removed 
  * Newlines in tweets rendered 
  * Four larger font sizes added 
  * Chocolaty installer added (choco install tweetz-desktop) 

I'll try to sneak in some more updates but other projects have me scrambling at the moment. Enjoy.

Available on the [downloads page](/downloads).
