TAB auto complete with wildcards

If you use the command shell in XP, then you probably already use the [TAB key for auto-complete](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310530). One new thing (to me anyways) is that this also works with wildcards, so you can type this: 

`devenv *.sln`

![Image of a tab key from a standard PC keyboard](http://www.myotherdrive.com/public/blueonion/Blog/tab_key.jpg) Hitting TAB will cycle through all files that match the pattern, for this example, you get this:

`devenv Kilroy.sln`

This is match faster than what I was doing before:

`devenv K`

Hitting TAB here, and you have to cycle through a dozen filenames that begin with K, before getting to the desired .sln file.
