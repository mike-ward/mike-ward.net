Arrived home late from [CodeMash 2009](http://codemash.org/) so I’m a day late posting. A very good conference. I’m thinking of volunteering for next year but more on that later.

[How to roll your own Mac for under 240$](http://www.uselessninjas.com/guides/msiwindosx/) – The ingenuity of people continues to amaze me. Step by step guide with lots of pictures.

[Android netbooks on their way, likely by 2010](http://venturebeat.com/2009/01/01/android-netbooks-on-their-way-likely-by-2010/) – I got my hands on an Android phone the other day. It’s very slick. Not quite as sexy as the iPhone but very fast and functional. Now there are rumors floating about a group that hacked Android to run on a netbook and why they think Google is planning a ground assault on these devices.

[Hard Lessons in the Importance of Backups: JournalSpace Wiped Out](http://lifehacker.com/5122848/hard-lessons-in-the-importance-of-backups-journalspace-wiped-out) – Sad story. Six years of blogs wiped out in an instant. I may not have the sexiest blog engine on the planet, but rolling my own means I control my data and how it’s managed.

[When a Phillips is not a Phillips!](http://www.instructables.com/id/When_a_Phillips_is_not_a_Phillips/) – I admit I’m something of a hand tool geek. Here is a list of screw drive types, from ancient Slot through to space-age Lox presented with a quick view of the screw head, the drive name, a picture of the appropriate drive bit, followed by an explanation of the type. Tool nerds rejoice!

['Make' magazine debuts television series | Gaming and Culture - CNET News](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10130544-52.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-5) – Make magazine is an interesting, if somewhat eclectic publication of inventions and do-it-yourself projects. This goes way beyond my [HeathKit](http://www.heathkit.com/) days. I suspect if your the type that likes “[How it’s Made](http://science.discovery.com/fansites/howitsmade/howitsmade.html)”, you’ll want to add this to your Tivo list.

[Using NDepend on large project, a success story - Patrick Smacchia [MVP C#]](http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2009/01/04/using-ndepend-on-large-project-a-success-story.aspx) – I’m actually familiar with this particular project. The “success” is a bit over stated in my opinion. It’s a tribute to NDepend that it can work on such a large project however.

[TG Daily - Our Milky Way galaxy is 50% bigger than previously thought](http://www.tgdaily.com/html_tmp/content-view-40850-113.html) – There’s a quote I heard years ago, “Not only is the Universe queerer than we know, it’s queerer than we can suppose.” News like this serves to remind us how limited our understanding remains.

[Macworld 2009: iWork '09 Includes iWork.com, Costs $79 + Subscription](http://i.gizmodo.com/5124555/apple-sends-iwork-to-the-clouds-introduces-iworkcom) – Interesting that they are charging when Google gives theirs away for free.

[Source code for Silverlight controls published](http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/01/08/silverlight-controls-source-code-released.aspx) – The cool thing about this is not that you can compile it or change it in your projects, but that bugs can be found and fixed much more quickly. Kudos to Microsoft.

[Push Your Web Design Into The Future With CSS3 | CSS | Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/01/08/push-your-web-design-into-the-future-with-css3/) – Who knows, maybe in 10 years we’ll actually get support for these features in browsers (HTML 4 is still not fully implemented). In the meantime, there are vendor specific extensions that can be used.

[How Many External Monitors are Attached to your Computer?](http://www.labnol.org/gadgets/external-monitor-attached-to-computer/6445/) – Nine screens. I’m just geeking out. Great pictures.
