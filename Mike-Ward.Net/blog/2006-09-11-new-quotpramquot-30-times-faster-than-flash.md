"The EETimes describes the new [Samsung memory, phase-change RAM, called PRAM](http://www.eetimes.com/news/semi/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=192700709). Samsung is dubbing it 'Perfect RAM' because it is thirty times faster than NOR flash, ten times more durable â€” and cheaper to produce, to boot."

My flash thumb drive is plenty fast for the things I do. What's exciting about this is that it just might be fast enough and cheap enough to replace hard drives. No hard drives means instant hibernation, faster access, and higher reliability. Imagine a PC where the only moving part is the fan. Let's hope it's not a smoke and mirrors announcement.
