Three Useful Programs
2007-09-27T23:06:54
Now that I have my [shiny new laptop](/blog/post/2007/09/25/new-notebook-new-operating-system) I'm revisiting many of the programs I use. Over the last couple of days I've found some new and useful programs.

[jZip](http://www.jzip.com/) - A relative newcomer in the Zip market, jZip is perhaps not as full featured as WinZip but it makes up for this by being simple to use. One of my many grips about WinZip is that there is no folder view. jZip supports both folder and flat views. It's based on the 7-zip engine so you know it's fast and reliable.

[Neil's Color Picker](http://notstatic.com/archives/96) - At 6.1 KB it's about as lightweight as they come. Hover over something with your mouse and press F7 and it copies the selected color to the clipboard. The format of the color code is configurable.

[SumatraPDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/) - This little guy just rocks. It has a minimalist design the favors simplicity over features. It loads fast up and because it's a single file with no external dependencies you can run it from an external USB drive as well.

Small, fast, free and useful. What are you're favorites?
