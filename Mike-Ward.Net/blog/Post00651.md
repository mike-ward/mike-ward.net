Tweetz 3.1–Beta 2
2011-01-06T00:19:42
What’s fixed:

**Bold Tweets** – New tweets are in bold font. This is a bug in the gadget platform that I forget about from time to time. Using any type of opacity fading causes fonts to go bold. Annoying.

**Reply/Retweet/Delete** – Some of you reported that [tweetz](/tweetz) sometimes referenced the wrong tweet in replies/retweets or that delete didn’t work. Turns out, Twitter changed how they generate tweet ids back in October. The new ids are non-sequential 64 bit numbers. JavaScript only has a 53 bit mantissa for representing numbers. As a result, numbers sometimes got rounded down. Twitter has remedied this by supplying a string version of the id. Using the string version eliminates rounding errors since it’s never converted to a number.

**No Chirp on Mentions** – I think I’ve got this one fixed. Never saw it on my system but then I don’t many mentions.

Also updated the Latvian and Hungarian translations. 

Keep them bug reports coming…
