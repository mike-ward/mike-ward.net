NonContiguousMemoryStream 1.2
2008-03-16T20:45:26
I've updated my MemoryStream replacement that handles large streams with less memory fragmentation. You can read about it [here](http://mike-ward.net/blog?p=ff982145-ae67-4a1b-9a23-9627e0198cfa). This version fixes a bug in the Seek method (specifically, SeekOrigin.End). I thought it should be illegal to seek past the end of a memory stream but apparently I'm wrong. The .NET MemoryStream allows this type of operation and so now does NonContiguousMemoryStream.
