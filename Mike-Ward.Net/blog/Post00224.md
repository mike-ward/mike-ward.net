2007-12-11T00:53:41
Everyone has a list of gadgets they want. I'm not what you would call a "gadget boy" and yet here I am with a list of gadgets as long as my sleeve. Guess my inner geek is expressing itself more than usual.

[Apple AirPort Express](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=AB47AE5&fnode=home/shop_mac/mac_accessories/airport_wireless&nplm=M9470LL/A)

I can't count the number of times I've been in meetings where there are not enough network connections.

[Spyderco byrdRench Multi-Tool](http://www.rei.com/product/759727)

A unique combination of pliers, crescent wrench and bit driver not found on other multi-tools.

[Sony Reader](http://products.sel.sony.com/pa/prs/index.html)

There's been a lot of noise about the Amazon Kindle as of late but I actually like the form and feel of the Sony Reader better. It can't download ebooks directly but that's not a deal breaker for me.

[HP MedaSmart Home Server](http://www.shopping.hp.com/store/product/product_detail/GG795AA%2523ABA?aoid=41243&kw=hp+mediasmart+home+server)

Must have more power...

[Pin Clock](http://www.amazon.com/Pin-Clock/dp/B000KESO8G/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1197332376&sr=8-10) - Thousands of perfectly aligned movable pins raise and lower to display the time in a 3D display. The pins magically reshuffle every minute by lifting and retracting to form the display of hours and minutes. Need I say more?
