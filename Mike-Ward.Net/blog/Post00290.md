I'm moving like cold molasses this morning with this head cold. Still, the blog must go on. Here's some stuff I found interesting this week when I didn't have a head cold.

[Programmers Don't Read Books -- But You Should](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001108.html) - Jeff Atwood's, "Coding Horror" is always a great read. I've read most of the books he recommends here.

[Better Pull Quotes: Don’t Repeat Markup](http://css-tricks.com/better-pull-quotes/) - CSS Tricks contains some very useful code, like this gem.

[A Great Visual Studio Add-on You Must Have](http://www.dev102.com/2008/04/29/a-great-visual-studio-add-on-you-must-have/) - I've used power commands for a while now. Seamless and useful.

[K-Meleon: It's like Firefox, without the bloat](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/04/29/k-melon-its-like-firefox-without-the-bloat/) - It's a little to light for my tastes but who knows, maybe you'll like it.

[LyX – The Document Processor](http://www.lyx.org/Home) - I still have my circa 1984 TeX reference. Still the best way to do book publishing. LyX is a combination of tools that makes TeX and LaTex a bit more word processor like.

[Fax Documents Over the Internet for Free to any Phone number in US](http://www.labnol.org/internet/tools/fax-documents-over-internet-free-unlimited/3116/) - Send unlimited number of faxes without registration, there are no ads attached to the fax sheets and each fax document can have up to 20 pages.

[Understanding IIS7 Request Restrictions on Windows Vista](http://blogs.iis.net/thomad/archive/2008/05/01/understanding-iis7-request-restrictions-on-windows-vista.aspx) - Just how many concurrent connections does Vista support. Answer, it depends...
