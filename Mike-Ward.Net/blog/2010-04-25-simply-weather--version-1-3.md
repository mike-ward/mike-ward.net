Simply Weather – Version 1.3
2010-04-25T14:25:00
Simply Weather is my no-nonsense weather gadget that displays the current conditions and forecast in a straightforward, easy to read format.

The location displayed at the top of the gadget is usually the name of the weather station reporting the weather. The station name is typically the name of a nearby city. Sometimes the station name is a bit unusual or too long to display within the confines of the gadget.

For those cases I’ve added a setting that allows you to customize location of the name displayed at the top of the gadget.

This does not change the reporting location, only what’s displayed in the gadget.
