With all the news about record cold temperatures (it was –14F the other morning sans wind chill) it’s interesting to note how much Windows can leak.

The temperature on the left is from a remote sensor placed outside away from the house so that it does not pick up any residual heat. The other is a sticky thermometer placed outside on a double pane window. The thermometers read to within a degree when placed near each other.

Nine degrees is a pretty steep temperature gradient. 

Our house has modern, high quality, double pane windows and we’ve found that keeping the drapes closed keeps the heat in and measurably lowers our heating bills.
