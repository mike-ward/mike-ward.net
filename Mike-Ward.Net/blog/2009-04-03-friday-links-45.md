[Live Smooth Streaming – Design Thoughts - Sam Zhang's Blog](http://blogs.iis.net/samzhang/archive/2009/03/27/live-smooth-streaming-design-thoughts.aspx) - In summary, the pull model we designed for IIS Live Smooth Streaming is very different than how the traditional live streaming push model works. With this model, the server becomes a very lean stateless server with better performance, scalability, and manageability. The client has more control over different aspects of streaming/playback and is better equipped to handle all the challenges to offer a great user experience.

This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
