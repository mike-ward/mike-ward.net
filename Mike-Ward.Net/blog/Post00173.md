If you don't see the flash player widget above (IE sometimes has problems with it), [click this link](http://www.feed2podcast.com/player/podcast_player.php?url=http://www.feed2podcast.com/podcast/49884907.xml) to use the Feed2Post player (which is also very cool by the way).

Ok, so I cheated just a bit. [Feed2Podcast](http://www.feed2podcast.com/) is a free service that converts any RSS feed to a podcast. It actually works much better than I expected. Simply point this free online service to your feed URL and it does the rest. You can customize the look of the widget or simply add the generated link to your Web site or blog. The voice synthesizing is quite good although it will stumble on constructs like $20 (Dollar 20). It's a great way to offer an alternate form of your feed.
