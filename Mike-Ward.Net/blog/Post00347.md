[Desk Drive](http://mike-ward.net/deskdrive) 1.4.7 includes two new features:

  * Bring settings window to foreground

The Chinese translation looks cool.

Anyone up for doing traditional Chinese? It's easy. Just edit the **DeskDrive.exe.xml** file in the distribution. Change the "Default" tags to render in your language of choice. Run the program and see your new translation. Send me the file and I'll add the new translation to the distribution. Don't forget to tell me which language it is since I'll likely not recognize it.

Currently, Desk Drive is translated into the following languages:

  * German
  * Italian
  * Finnish
  * Japanese
  * Simplified Chinese
  * Slovenian 

The "Settings" dialog pictured above also had a habit of hiding behind other windows which made it difficult to find. It now comes to the foreground when activated. It also displays in the task bar while visible.
