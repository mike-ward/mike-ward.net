![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/BlueOnionSoftware/Blog/CpuMeter.png) Windows Live Writer Beta 2 is out. Others have blogged about it's many new features. To be sure it's one of the nicer off-line blog editors available today. But alas, with all the new features came one really annoying bug. When I first start the program, it pegs the CPU for about 5 minutes. Fortunately, there's a fix. Run **services.msc** and then disable the **Windows Live Setup Service**. Problem solved.
