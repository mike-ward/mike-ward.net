Cigars International - Nice!

![](http://www.cigarsinternational.com/graphics/cilogo.jpg) I've been buying my cigars for years from [this outfit](http://cigarsinternational.com). They have the best prices, the best service and their reviews are spot on in my opinion. For even better deals, get on their mailing list. About twice a week you get an email with limited time offers. The email deals are often outstanding and can represent a sizeable savings. Highly recommended.

P.S. I don't get paid or otherwise compensated for these comments. I'm just a guy who likes to buy stuff on the Internet and report my experiences.
