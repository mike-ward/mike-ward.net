I released this update a couple of days ago but have been busy with family stuff which is why this post is a few days behind. This release has some minor bug fixes and language updates.

  * Fixed url shortening eating leading space
  * Updated Greek translation
  * Fixed UTF8 issues with Spanish 
  * Added Dutch translation
  * Updated Aqua theme

Available on the [downloads page](http://mike-ward.net/downloads).
