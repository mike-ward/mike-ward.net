Google does a great job at key word searches but it is less adept at answering questions like the follow:

  * What time is it at Google Headquarters? 
  * Is Jennifer Lopez single? 
  * Who wrote the Principia Mathematica? 
  * Who are Queen Elizabeth II’s grandchildren? 
  * List the US states as of the third July 1832? 
  * Is a Dolphin a mammal? 

The Internet Answer Engine™ [true knowledge](http://www.trueknowledge.com) aims to fix that problem. They’re pioneering technology improves Internet search by understanding complex questions and finding known facts. It’s a hugely cool and ambitious idea. Early beta’s were slow and a bit frustrating but the newest release appears to be much more polished and useable. The demo video is an excellent walkthrough with commentary.

I’ve been given 20 invites to this invitation only beta. First come, first serve.
