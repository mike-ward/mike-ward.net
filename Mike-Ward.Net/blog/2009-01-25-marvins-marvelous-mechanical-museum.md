Marvin’s Marvelous Mechanical Museum

Yesterday, the family and I went to a really [interesting little museum](http://marvin3m.com/). Well, that’s what they call it but it’s more of an arcade.

I found out about this museum from an [episode of Modern Marvels on the History Channel](http://www.pinrepair.com/movies/marvin1.wmv). It’s a collection of old-time mechanical (well, mostly mechanical) amusements. Some of them are just too funny. My favorite? **Kill R Watt Challenge!**

Not the best picture. The idea is you hold on to the two probes while the mechanical guy taunts you and sends a mild electrical shock through the probes.

Some of are gruesome depicting torture and executions (not in a scary way however) while others are just plain odd.

Most are whimsical and all are kid safe. There was a mechanized music machine that was just a marvel of ingenuity.

In addition to all the arcade games, there is a treasure trove of old time circus and magician posters (Alexander, he knows all!). Lots of old time airplane models and other contraptions. Most amusements are a quarter with some of the cooler ones (like Kill R Watt Challenge) are 50 cents. It’s a fun way to spend an afternoon with the family.
