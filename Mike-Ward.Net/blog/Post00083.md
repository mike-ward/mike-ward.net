Windows Live Writer Test

This entry tests [Microsoft's Windows Live Writer](http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1) (WLW) with [Bloget](http://mike-ward.net/bloget). Looks like things are working well. One major issue was getting categories to work. After hours of searching, I found that WLW wants a title and categoryid included in the struct of the metaWeblog.getCategories response. If you examine the RFC for the [MetaWebLog Api](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi) you'll find no such parameters. Why can't we adhere to the standard? The standard is as the standard does I suppose.

As for the WLW, it's pretty darn nice. It feels better than any of the other offline editors I've used to date. The interface just feels right for whatever reason. There are a few bugs but then again, it is beta software. Also, no spell checking as you type. Nice going Microsoft.
