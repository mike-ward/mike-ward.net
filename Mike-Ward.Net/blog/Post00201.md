Vista One Month Later
2007-10-18T00:30:06
I mentioned earlier that I couldn't figure out why people hate Vista so much. I've found it to be stable fast and fun to use. I suspect the people who are railing on it so much either haven't used it or are predisposed to disliking anything Microsoft.

Interestingly, I haven't found the need to tweak Vista much. It just works. Also, it seems like I run fewer applications on Vista because I just don't seem to need as many as I did in XP. For instance, I have not installed a desktop search utility because Vista comes with one that works well.

It's been about a month now and I've used the system enough to think that most of the programs important to me are installed now. Here's a quick snap shot of what I've installed to date. 

[AxCrypt](http://www.axantum.com/AxCrypt/) - File Encryption for Windows. Right-click integration with Windows Explorer makes AxCrypt the easiest way to encrypt individual files in Windows. Double-click integration makes it as easy to open, edit and save encrypted files as it is to work with unencrypted files.

[Calendar](http://mike-ward.net/calendar) - Nifty little program by your's truly.

[DeskDrive](http://mike-ward.net/deskdrive) - Automatic drive/media shortcuts for desktop (shameless plug #2)

[DoubleDesktop](http://www.fatfreesoft.com/2desk.php) - There are other desktop management programs but I've always returned to DoubleDesktop because it does just enough and I never get lost or confused using it.

[DPack 2.8.0](http://www.usysware.com/dpack/) - Visual Studio plugin with many features. Personally, I only use the solution backup utility but it works better than anything I've found to date. Supports VS 2008.

[Evernote 2](http://www.evernote.com/en/) - Simply the best note taking, note organizing utility for windows.

[FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/) - Simply the best FTP client for windows. I like the older 2.x version better than the 3.0 version.

[FireBug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843) - A FireFox plugin that gives you XRay vision for any web page. Phenomenal.

[FreeSnap](http://mike-ward.net/freesnap) - Nifty little window management utility (shameless plug #3).

[Google GMail Notifier](http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_windows.html) - If you use GMail, you want this

[HashTab](http://www.beeblebrox.org/hashtab/) - Adds a tab called "File Hashes" to the Windows Explorer file properties. Makes checking MD5, SHA1 and CRC-32 file hashes a snap.

[iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) - Nuff said

[McAfee Security Center](http://security.comcast.net/) - I actually prefer NOD32 but this one comes free with my Comcast Internet service. If you have Comcast, you're entitled to up 6 copies of this suite. Works well on Vista.

[MS Visual Studio 2008](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx) - Works better than VS 2005 and allows you to write .NET 2.0 as well and 3.0 and 3.5. The installer projects are a bit underdone but otherwise, very stable.

[Mozilla FireFox 2.0](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) - Better than Internet Explorer, and more fun too!

[MozyHome](http://mozy.com/) - 2GB of free automatic backup. Not enough for your music library, but for other types of documents it's usually enough. The automatic feature is just killer.

[NUnit 2.4.3](http://www.nunit.org/) - If you develop .NET applications, you need this. Also included in TestDriven.NET

[Opera 9.5](http://www.opera.com/) - It really is the faster browser and seems to feel better with every release. Not quite ready to give-up FireFox but it's getting close.

[PSPad Editor](http://www.pspad.com/) - Nifty notepad replacement with syntax highlighting, line numbering and more.

[Reflector](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/) - So useful it hurts. It's hard to imagine .NET programming without this tool. Checkout the add-Ins as well.

[StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/) - Finds stuff you never knew you couldn't live without!

[S3Fox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3247) - A FireFox plug-in that lets you organize/manage/store your files on [Amazon S3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261). 

[Sumatra PDF Reader](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/) - A small (single file) PDF reader that whips the pants off of Acrobat Reader.

[TestDriven.NET 2.8 Personal](http://www.testdriven.net/) - Again, if you're developing .NET programs you want this. Makes writing and running unit tests much easier.

[VirtualCloneDrive](http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html) - Makes using .iso files a breeze. Just double-click the the image file to mount.

[VistaFirewallControl](http://www.sphinx-soft.com/Vista/) - Vista has a full-duplex firewall but it's almost impossible to configure. Works like ZoneAlarm in that it asks your permission before allowing network access to programs.

[Windows Live Writer](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/13/windows-live-writer/) - Who knew Microsoft could write great blog authoring software?

[WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/) - Text file differencing and merging utility

Considering the amount of time I spend on the computer, this list is really pretty short. Still, without these programs my computer would be much less useful and interesting. What are you favorites?
