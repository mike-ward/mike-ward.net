Changing Build Output Verbosity in VS 2005
2007-05-03T01:43:15
When builds go wrong, it's important to know where in the process things broke. The [MSBuild](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wea2sca5(VS.80).aspx) default verbosity setting in Visual Studio 2005 is set to _minimal_ but you can change it by going to **Tools.Options...** and navigating to **Projects and Solutions** and then **Build and Run**.

Setting the output to _Detailed_ gives much more detailed information about the build and can be a real help in debugging.
