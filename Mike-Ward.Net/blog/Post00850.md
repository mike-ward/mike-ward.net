Average Response Time on Azure
2013-08-06T14:28:09
Out of curiosity, I set up my blog software to run on the new Azure Web sites service and then monitored the response times as compared to my current hosting service. Data centers for both services are located in the US.

Considering both services are using a shared hosting environment, I'm surprised the Azure site is 3 times slower (in the US).

This is in no way a comprehensive test of Azure hosting, just an interesting data point.

Any thoughts on why this might be?
