Tweetz 3.1 Update
2011-05-17T00:11:28
Just a quickie maintenance release. The Hungarian translation has been updated and [tweetz](/tweetz) has been ported to [jQuery 1.6.1](http://jquery.com). I try to keep up with the changes in jQuery, especially as of late since recent releases have had breaking changes. In theory, the gadget should benefit from improvements in the jQuery library, particularly in the areas of animation and attribute lookup.

I’m currently working on updates to [Bloget](/bloget), my ASP.NET blog engine that has faithfully served this blog since 2006. Recent changes to .NET have prompted me to update the code base and kill a few bugs that have been lying around for far too long. Unfortunately, since there’s only one of me, tweetz updates will be on hold for a while except for quick fixes like today.

Available on the [downloads page](/downloads).
