My Favorite VS 2008 Feature

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/BlueOnionSoftware/Blog/usings.png) Visual Studio 2008 will be releasing soon. It's a nice evolutionary development of Visual Studio 2005 with no jarring changes or surprises. In general, things just seem to work better. I've been developing actively with beta 2 and have found it to be a pleasure to use. There are lots of little (and big) improvements but easily my favorite is the the "Remove and Sort" usings command. Click it and it will remove your unused using statements (say that 10 times) and sort them. Something us anal retentive types just can't resist.
