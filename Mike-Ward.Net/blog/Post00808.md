CodeMash 2.0.1.3

This was my 6th year at [Codemash](http://codemash.org).

Neil Fords’ keynote on [Presentation Patterns](http://presentationpatterns.com/) was mind expanding. No really, presentations. Who knew?

JavaScript prototypes are confusing because the prototype-chain and prototype-property have the same name. The magic? The prototype-property is a reference to the prototype-chain. It’s that simple. +1 to [Guy Royse](http://www.guyroyse.com/) for his clear and witty presentation.

[Jen Myers](http://jenmyers.net/) made a compelling presentation on why designers are important to software development.

Remember the “Choose Your Own Adventure” books? It was inspiration for the [ChooseYourOwnApplication](http://chooseyourownapplication.com/) project. Curious about how to construct websites with [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), or [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)? How would it work using [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) and JavaScript? ChooseYourOwnApplication allows you to write the same single page web site using all the mentioned technologies and more. There are 30 different combinations. Don’t’ like typing? There are [GitHub](https://github.com/SrtSolutions/cyOverflow-backbone-javascript/commit/889ce0ffb6c1af9d3d5704247b0c4c7c409b6851) repos of every stage for every combination.

[Jimmy Bogard](http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/) presented some interesting ways to functionally test your web site using [Watin](http://watin.org/) and [Gallio](http://www.gallio.org/).

JavaScript test frameworks like [qUnit](http://qunitjs.com/), [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) have different approaches to testing. Writing the same tests in all three platforms was illuminating. I’ve always liked qUnit but Mocha is certainly a head turner.

[Roslyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Roslyn) is the codename for Microsoft’s rewrite of the C# compiler. Why? It provides a way to add an API for tooling and for compiler as a service type functions. Their tool of choice for performance issues? [Event Tracing for Windows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb968803(v=vs.85).aspx). These guys really do dog food. 

I ran an Open Spaces talk on [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org). I really like this MVC framework for ASP.Net. It takes all of about 20 minutes to grok it. I also found I suck at explaining it to others.

Breakfast was almost entirely devoid of non-protein substances. Somehow, I didn’t mind.

[Brian Prince’s](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdhunt/6705666087/) blue-ish hair dye was not a fun and last years green. Orange would have matched the orange hoodies that were a decided upgrade from the usual T-shirts.

I missed the [Bourbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey) and Scotch tasting. I later made up for it by drinking someone else’s [good Bourbon](http://www.internetwines.com/mb311564.html).

One of the game rooms was setup to play [Artemis](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/), a real-time 5-person spaceship simulator game. Each team member is given a role like Capitan or Navigator. I was the Engineer. Bad things happen if you let the warp-core overheat.

My favorite [door decoration](http://codemash.doorcomp.com/) was all black and said, “The Bacon is a Lie”. It wasn’t, especially with honey mustard.
