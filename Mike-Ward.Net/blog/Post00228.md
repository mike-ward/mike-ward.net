![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/65/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car_Poster.jpg/200px-Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car_Poster.jpg) If you haven't seen the movie "[Who Killed the Electric Car](http://www.sonyclassics.com/whokilledtheelectriccar/)", then rent it, buy it, steal it or borrow it and watch it. I own a GM vehicle. My Dad worked for GM for 30 years. After watching this **I will never own a GM vehicle again**. I get a sizable discount on GM vehicles because of my Dad's employment. Doesn't matter any more. After watching this movie, I'm mad as hornet at how GM (and others) killed a great alternative to gasoline vehicles. Shame on the automotive industry, shame on the government and shame on us as consumers for not demanding better.
