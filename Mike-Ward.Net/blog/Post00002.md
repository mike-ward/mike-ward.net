Back From Germany
2006-06-23T22:59:25
Had to take a few days off to fly to Germany. My day job requires regular trips to the Germany these days. I really like the food there, maybe a bit too much.

As you can see from the site, I've been playing with DotNetNuke skins. You could make a full time job out just skinning sites. I'm trying to stay focused however and get this thing done.

Calendar Gadget is also coming along. I've finally resolved an issue I had with how to reference images in a not too confusing way. :)

I'm hoping to ship the first alpha soon. Hang in there...
