![](http://az667460.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/images/blog/FridayLinks27_979B/tinytags_thumb.png) FreeSnap 1.5 includes these new features:

  * Task switcher: Another task switcher? Yes, but this is faster and easier. No fancy thumbnails. It simply switches to the next/previous task. After all, do you want to go the the next task or do you want to be entertained with 3D graphics?
  * Half screen sizing: mimics the Windows 7 feature of snapping a window to a half or quarter screen. A [previous post](/blog/post/2008/11/17/freesnap-1-5-beta-2) illustrates the concept. 
  * Settings via config file: – The command line was getting a bit overloaded so I’ve moved all settings to configuration file 

There’s more documentation on these new features on the [FreeSnap page](/freesnap). Enjoy and send feedback.
