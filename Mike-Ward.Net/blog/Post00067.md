The Dilbert Blog Rocks

I'm probably the last person on the planet to discover this but the [Dlibert Blog](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com) rocks. It's way better than the comic and is very topical. The [Clerics and Analogies](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/10/clerics_and_ana.html) post is an good example of the humor and thinking that goes into the posts. Hat's off to Scott Adams. Now if I can only convince Scott to dump that silly old [TypePad](http://typepad.com) blog and use [Bloget](http://mike-ward.net/bloget) instead.
