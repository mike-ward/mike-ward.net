[![Educated](/content/images/blog/HailtotheVictors_81BE/Educated_thumb.jpg)](/content/images/blog/HailtotheVictors_81BE/Educated.jpg) I've lived in Ann Arbor and the surrounding area since the Winter of 1979. I've often thought Ann Arbor is one of Michigan's best kept secrets. Apparently, I'm not alone. Two years ago, Google opened up shop here and today's Google blog [gushes](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/hello-from-a2.html) about what a great place Ann Arbor is to live.

  * _AARP Magazine_ recently named Ann Arbor the [healthiest hometown in America](http://www.aarpmagazine.org/lifestyle/healthiest_hometowns.html/page=2), based on 20 factors ranging from the community's water purity to the eating habits of its citizens. 
  * According to Forbes.com, Ann Arbor is America's [4th Smartest City](http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/07/americas-smartest-cities-oped-cx_apa_0207smartest_slide_5.html?thisSpeed=15000). 
  * Oprah Winfrey included a brisket sandwich from our own Zingerman's Deli on her [Top Sandwiches in America.](http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/05/zingermans_deli_makes_oprahs_l.html)
  * Ann Arbor ranks in the [top 21 cities for cyclists](http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-9,00.html), says _Bicycling_ magazine. 
  * And [even more](http://www.concentratemedia.com/features/AnnArborList0017.aspx?utm_campaign=How%20We%20Stack%20Up&utm_medium=Email&utm_source=VerticalResponse&utm_term=Ann%20Arbor%27s%20On%20The%20List)... 

With all the bad news coming out of Michigan these days, it's a refreshing change to hear something nice about our fair state.
