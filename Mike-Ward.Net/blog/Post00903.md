Github Expandinizr

Rarely has an extension improved my web browsing experience like [GitHub Expandinizr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/githubexpandinizr/cbehdjjcilgnejbpnjhobkiiggkedfib?hl=en). What it does:

  * Removes the truncating of file and directory names in the repository browser
  * Really long file and directory names will word-wrap
  * Fully expands the website, with breakpoints at 1400px, 1600px and 1800px
