Google maps has added new features that allow you to create personalized, annotated, customized maps using Google Maps.

>   * [Lines](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/userguide/index.html#lines)
>   * [Shapes](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/userguide/index.html#shapes)
> 
> Once you have created a map, you can: 
> 
>   * Add descriptive text, including [rich text and HTML](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/userguide/index.html#text)
>   * Embed [photos](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/userguide/index.html#photos) and [videos](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/userguide/index.html#videos) in your map 
>   * [Share your maps with others](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/userguide/index.html#share)

I gave it a quick spin. We're having a neighborhood garage sale in May so I thought I might create a [map](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&q=&msa=0&msid=103050620671398768269.00000112192372214bbf6) for our neighborhood web site announcement. It took all of 2 minutes to annotate the map and include it on our Web site. As I get confirmations on who wants to participate in the garage sale, I'll add them to the map. Pretty cool!.
