Testing with WB Editor2

Testing with [WB Editor 2](http://www.wbeditor.com/). This editor looks and works better than many of the others I've tested with. It appears to use FTP to upload images instead of the MetaWeblog API (bummer). It supports draft mode and multiple blogs. For some reason there are no tool tips on the toolbar. Makes it a little difficult to figure out what some of the buttons do. Good feel overall.
