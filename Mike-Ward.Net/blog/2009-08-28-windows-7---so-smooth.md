Windows 7 - So Smooth

[![windows7](/cdn/images/blog/Windows7SoSmooth_13996/windows7_thumb.jpg)](/cdn/images/blog/Windows7SoSmooth_13996/windows7.jpg) I’ve been running the RTM version of Windows 7 for about 2 weeks now and I have to say it works so smoothly as to be boring. I’m actually having to “just use” my computer. No tweaking, no tinkering. What’s a “Dyed in the wool” geek like myself suppose to do?

There are plenty of articles out there about all the features so I won’t repeat them here. However, there are a few tidbits I’ve come across that are worth mention.

  * Search – Just drop dead on. Fast, accurate and topical. It’s Google for your desktop. I don’t feel the need to use launchers like (the very excellent) [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/).
  * Shutdown progress – The process of shutting down shows you the status of programs as they close. I can’t find a screen shot of this but it’s emblematic of the subtle and useful touches found everywhere.

My Bluetooth headset has never worked better, music sounds better and stuff, well, just works. I could get use to just “using my computer”.
