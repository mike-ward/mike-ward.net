Politics aside this is just plain [scary](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2006/12/13/bush-admin-clamps-down-o_n_36290.html). To paraphrase the great senator Daniel Moynihan, "the Bush Administration is entitled to their own opinions, but they're not entitled to their own facts". 

> The Bush administration is clamping down on scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey, the latest agency subjected to controls on research that might go against official policy. 
> 
> New rules require screening of all facts and interpretations by agency scientists who study everything from caribou mating to global warming. The rules apply to all scientific papers and other public documents, even minor reports or prepared talks, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press.
