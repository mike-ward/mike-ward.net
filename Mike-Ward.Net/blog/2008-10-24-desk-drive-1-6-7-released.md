Desk Drive 1.6.7 Released

[Desk Drive](/deskdrive) 1.6.7 adds one minor but useful feature. Many of you have asked that the “X” button in the upper-right corner of the dialog hide the program rather than close it.

I have to admit there are many times I clicked this button only to realize later that I closed the program accidentally. You can still close the program from the tray or icon or by pressing Alt+F4 when the dialog has focus.
