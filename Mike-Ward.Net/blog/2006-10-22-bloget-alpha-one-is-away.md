Bloget Alpha One is Away

As mentioned in an earlier blog, there comes a time in every software project when you have to shoot the developers (or in this case, myself) and ship.

BANG!

Ouch! Wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.

Like most things, the devil is in the details and writing your own blog software is no different. The more I work at it the longer my list of things to do gets. Still, there is something mildly intoxicating about writing Bloget that keeps me going.

Bloget is a bit different than some of the other ASP.NET blogging offerings in that it is an ASP.NET 2.0 control. Basically that means you have to place it in an existing ASP.NET Web page. It also doesn't use a database for storage but instead relies on XML files (similar to [dasBlog](http://dasBlog.net) I imagine). It doesn't require modifying your Web.config and should run on shared hosting services like [GoDaddy.com](http://GoDaddy.com)

You can read more about it [here](/bloget) and download it [here](/downloads).

Have fun and send feedback.
