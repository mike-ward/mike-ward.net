X1 Desktop Search Now Free
2006-10-13T23:32:47
I'm a little late to the party on this one but according to the [Langa Blog](http://www.langa.com/blog/2006/10/best-indexed-search-tool-youve-never.htm#links), X1 desktop search is now **free** and has been since June of this year. Yahoo desktop search is based on [X1](http://www.x1.com/download/). It's a fast download weighing in at 12 MB. Installed in a snap and indexed my hard drive in less than 5 minutes compared to an hour for Google Desktop and Microsoft Desktop search. Apparently it phones home a lot but it can be turned off in the options menu. I let ZoneAlarm keep it off the net as well. Lightweight, fast and free. Hard to resist.
