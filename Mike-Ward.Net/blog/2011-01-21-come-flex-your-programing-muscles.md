Come “Flex” your Programing Muscles

[Codemash](http://codemash.org) is a regional conference that has grown from humble beginnings 5 years ago into a world class conference. It’s one of my primary sources for learning “new stuff”. Hey, one of the reasons we programmers love what we do is that there’s always “new stuff” to learn.

Last year it was functional paradigms. And this year? [Adobe Flex](http://flex.org). Yeah, I know it’s been around for a while but it just never made it on to my radar. That is until I saw [Brian Genisio’s](http://houseofbilz.com/) excellent [presentation on Flex](http://houseofbilz.com/archives/2011/01/11/codemash-slides-and-demos/).

Coming from C# and Silverlight, Flex struck me as a remarkably similar platform. It’s advantages are that it's more portable than Silverlight and to my mind, easier to grasp. Want to learn more? Check out [Tour De Flex](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/tourdeflex.html). Doesn’t matter if you’re running Linux, Mac or even Windows (gasp!). It’ll just work. Tour De Flex should easily convince you that rich front ends can be written in Flex.

I’ve attended several of James’ presentations. He is an excellent speaker and teacher. It’s a great opportunity to learn from the best.

Come join me and others February 15-17 for a “Flex Jam”. Bring a problem or a project to work on. Work with other “Kindred souls” and learn from the best. Don’t have a project in mind? No worries. There will be labs and content to help you learn from the ground up. What’s great about this Jam that there is no set agenda. Come, learn, program, collaborate and learn a new platform in the process.
