Windows Vista SP1 - No Issues

![](http://www.microsoft.com/library/media/1033/windows/images/shop/vista-box.gif) With all the negative press out there about Windows Vista SP1, I would like to report that some of us have some how managed to install the service pack despite Microsoft's best efforts (yes, that was sarcasm). Really, it was a no brainer. Downloaded the bits last night (~450 MB) and ran the install. It took about 45 minutes and it was done. It was bit anticlimactic from what I was expecting given all the bad press. Geez, it couldn't even manage one lousy little plague of locus.

And no my computer didn't slow down or my peripherals stop working or my head fall off. I don't know, maybe I'm just lucky but Vista has easily been the easiest and best operating system of the Windows series to date. Still, there are those here at the office that will swear on a stack of bibles that running Vista is paramount to committing suicide. Curiously, these are the same people who have never tried to use Vista. Still, they're experts on the matter. Don't believe me? Just ask them.

Alright, enough rants. Yeah it's different, yeah it occasionally asks me to type my password in, and yeah others have real issues. Sounds a bit like Windows XP before SP2 but then who am I to open old wounds? If you're getting new hardware, Vista is really worth the look provided you can open your mind up to a new things just a little. And if you're willing to live on the wild-side (wink-wink) then [here's a link to the Vista SP1 bits](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsvista/bb738089.aspx).
