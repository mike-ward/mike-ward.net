![](http://www.google.com/goog411/images/goog411-logo.gif) The idea is so simple and yet brilliant. Call the toll free number 1-800-GOOG-411 (4664-411) and using just your voice, get information about local businesses. It even dials for you. The voice recognition is excellent and apparently required extensive training. From Google:

> It's a voice-based local search service, which means it uses speech-recognition algorithms to recognize what a caller is saying and then finds the local business information he or she is looking for. These algorithms had to be trained with real utterances, much like how a baby learns language by listening to its parents. Since its unveiling in April, GOOG-411 has successfully served millions of callers. And we owe a big thanks to everyone who took our speech recognition algorithms from infancy to adulthood!

To mark the occasion, they're celebrating with a [brand new website](http://www.google.com/goog411/index.html) that includes a fun video.
