Robert Scoble, notable blogging [personality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Scoble) and former Microsoft employee, [talks about his feelings](http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/08/first-day-of-post-microsoft-sadness/) now that it Windows Vista has released to manufacturing. Of particular interest are comments 15 and 19, both from a WPF Program Manager at Microsoft. Most of the conversation centers around .NET and the lack of it in Vista.
