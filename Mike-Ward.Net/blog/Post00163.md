Silverlight Demo

Microsoft announced some new and very cool technology at [Mix](http://visitmix.com/) in Las Vegas last week. [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/) (formerly called WPF/E) allows you to run .NET applications in your browser (a bit of an over simplification) and it's cross platform. You can read all about it at the Mix and Silverlight websites. For fun I thought I try uploading and streaming a video. It's a bit of work since there are not many authoring tools available. Directions on how to do this can be found [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2007/04/30/silverlight-streaming-is-now-live.aspx). It's not for the faint of heart.

What's interesting here is that the video is streaming live from Microsoft's Silverlight servers. In otherwords, Microsoft is paying for the bandwidth. You can get a free account and do the samething at [Silverlight.live.com](http://silverlight.live.com/). Secondly, this is a **.NET application running in the browser**. I could add overlays, other controls, etc. This is one of the stock player templates but it's not hard to imagine much cooler applications using this technology. I can't wait to try this on a Mac (yeah, it runs on a Mac).

Incidentally, this is a home video from our recent trip to Seaworld in Florida. Peter and Rachel, my son and daughter went on a special back lot tour all because I asked one of the handlers questions about the flamingos. Nice people!
