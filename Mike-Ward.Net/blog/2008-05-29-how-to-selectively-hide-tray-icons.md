How to Selectively Hide Tray Icons

I've had a number of requests to add a feature to Desk Drive that hides the tray icon. Turns out, you already have the ability to do this from the task bar. Here's how.

  * Right-click on the "Start" button on the task bar
  * Select the Taskbar tab

  * Check the "Hide inactive icons" checkbox
  * Click the customize button to the right of the checkbox
  * Select Desk Drive in the list
  * Use the drop-down box to select "Always hide"

  * Click OK
  * Click OK again

The Desk Drive icon is now hidden. You can use this same technique to manage other tray icons as well.
