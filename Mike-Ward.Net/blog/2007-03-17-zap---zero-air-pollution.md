ZAP! - Zero Air Pollution

[ZAP](http://www.zapworld.com/) makes alternative fuel vehicles including all electrics. The Obvio 012 pictured above goes from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, has a range of 200-240 miles per charge and can recharge in 10 minutes. They're not in production until later this year. I could see myself driving this vehicle most of the time since many of my trips are under 20 miles one way. And at a penny per mile operating cost is very low. It's a bit pricey at 49k and maybe a bit too cute in the styling department but it's definitely worth consideration if you want an all-electric.
