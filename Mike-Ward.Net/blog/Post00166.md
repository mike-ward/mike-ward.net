[DoubleDesktop](http://www.fatfreesoft.com/2desk.php) is a smart and elegant system tray utility that effectively doubles the width of your Windows desktop. It's simpler to use than many similar programs: just mouse-click on its icon or hit a keystroke combination to switch between "left" and "right" parts of the desktop. This lets you easily rearrange all your application windows between the two desktop parts.

I've used this program for years and when I introduce it to others they are pleasantly surprised. The program itself is simplicity. It creates two desktops that you can switch between instantly using a key stroke or tray icon. I like it for development on my laptop. I keep Visual Studio 2005 one screen and MSDN Help on the other. It's a nice substitute when you don't have two screens. Highly recommended.
