Tweetz 2.0 – Beta 5
2010-02-18T02:24:47
What’s new:

  * **Performance**: The gadget purges older tweets from memory. This should help greatly with overall performance.
  * **More Links**: Like the web site, when you get to the end of the tweet list, there’s a “- more –” link that gets the next 20 tweets.

I’m zeroing in on the 2.0 release. The more link on the search panel is not working just yet. Also working on rounded corners for the background (no I didn’t forget).

Available on the [downloads page](/downloads).
