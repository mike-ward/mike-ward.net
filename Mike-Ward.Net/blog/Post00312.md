FreeSnap 1.3 and Desk Drive in the Wild

[![Free download software](http://www.soft82.com/images/awards/soft82_award_88x88.gif)](http://www.soft82.com/)It's been about a week now since I released version 1.3 of FreeSnap. Haven't heard a peep out of anyone as to problems. Guess I must be writing perfect code :). Really folks, I'm curious if the multi-monitor support is working out for you so drop me a line. 

Some download sites have picked up on my changes. Soft82 rated [FreeSnap](http://www.soft82.com/download/windows/freesnap/) 5 stars. [Downloadtube.com](http://www.downloadtube.com/Windows/System-Utilities/FreeSnap-download.html) gave it a 9 out of 10 and added the following comment.

> A really great little tool, also free, that allows you to move and resize the windows only with your keypad.

I've been tossing around an idea of adding task switching to FreeSnap. My problem with most task switchers is that they are modal. Most either pop-up a window with some type of a view of the current running tasks or aim for an Expose type experience (Expose is the Mac form of task switching). My thought is that task switching should do just that, switch to the next task. No fancy pop-ups, no shrinking the windows, no graying the screen. Just pick the next window in the sequence and activate it. Appreciate any feedback.

[Desk Drive](/deskdrive) activity has been off the charts (at least for me). There was something like 20,000 downloads last week. Interestingly, the majority of those came from Japan. Not bad for a non-localized program. By the way, it could be localized if someone wanted to take the time. There's only like half-a-dozen strings in it.

One final note. I would really appreciate it if you would subscribe to this blog. The larger subscriber numbers help in attracting quality advertisers and keeps me motivated.
