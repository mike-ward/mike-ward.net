Simply Weather 1.4.3

Another rapid-fire update. This update addresses some of the "Offline" issues some of you may experience. Normally, the gadget only tries to get weather data every 10 minutes. However, there are situations where your Internet connection may not be ready. This is particularly true when you first login to your system. If the gadget gets started before the Internet connection is available, it will be a whole 10 minutes before it tries again. It "looks" like the gadget has forgotten your location. It hasn't.

With this version, when the gadget detects an error getting weather data, it will go into a rapid check mode and try every 10 seconds until it gets a good response. This should handle some of the connection issues some of you have experienced. Of course there are lots of things that can block the gadget's access to the Internet including firewalls and antivirus programs. It's frustrating I know and I have no special powers to bypass these safeguards.
