![bugs](http://az667460.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/images/blog/DeskDrive1.6.8Released_14626/bugs.gif) Desk Drive 1.6.7 introduced a bug that makes logging off/shutdown take longer than it normally does. I didn’t notice it on my system because I almost never shut my laptop down. Honestly, I didn’t notice a difference even after someone pointed it out, but I’m receiving enough reports to believe it’s a real problem. It probably has something to do with my running Vista and not Windows XP. Anyways, apologies to anyone who was inconvenienced. In theory it should be fixed in 1.6.8 although I really don’t have a good way to verify this. Let me if you find otherwise.
