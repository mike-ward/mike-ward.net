Tweetz Update (3.1.5.3)
2011-12-26T23:35:17
I know, it's been a while. I have to take some time off from programming every so often to feed my other hobbies and obligations. This is a minor release to get me back in the groove of editing JavaScript code. Here's what's changed.

Search was and always has been somewhat broken. It should be somewhat less broken now.

Scrolling sometimes got chunky slow after switching tabs. Seems to have had something to do with focus on gadget. I think I've fixed it but then againâ€¦

Updated to jQuery 1.7.1

I had some outstanding reports about DM's not working. It may just be a poor interface issue. You need to use the Message item in the "right-click" menu. Also, the person needs to be following you. (This is a twitter rule)

Someone also made a new theme which I'll get around to adding soon. Don't hesitate to re-request features. I've sort of lost track.
