From the department of "Why didn't I notice this before?" comes a very useful command line tip. By selecting the **Quick Edit Mode** check box, you enable copy and paste from the Command Prompt window. To copy, select the text in the Command Prompt window with your left mouse button, and then right-click. To paste, either at the command prompt or in a text file, right-click. It works with the windows clip board as well. Copy something from a windows application and then right-click in the command prompt. How did I live with out this wonder?
