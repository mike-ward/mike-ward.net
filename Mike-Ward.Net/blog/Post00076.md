Dr. Dobbs Portal has an [interesting interview](http://www.ddj.com/blog/windowsblog/archives/2006/11/msdn_wiki_whats.html) with members of the MSDN Wiki team.

> The [MSDN Wiki](http://msdnwiki.microsoft.com/en-us/mtpswiki/default.aspx) was launched last June with the goal of extending the documentation for VS2005 and the .NET Framework. Although the project doesn't truly wiki-fy the MSDN docs -- opening them up to global edit -- it does provide a forum for readers' comments and code snippets to augment the official docs. Additionaly the project lets users improve the text of the machine-translated, non-English versions of the documentation. In its first few months, many Microsoft insiders have posted hundreds of additional insights. The MSDN Wiki has RSS feeds, so you can stay on top of hot topics.
