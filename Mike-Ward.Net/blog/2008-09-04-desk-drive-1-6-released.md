Desk Drive 1.6 Released
2008-09-04T16:30:12
[![usb memory stick](/cdn/images/blog/DeskDrive1.6Released_974A/usb.jpg)](/deskdrive) Desk Drive 1.6 features the option to open Windows Explorer when it detects a new drive. In addition, you should notice that Desk Drive memory usage as indicated by the Task Manager is considerably less.

Several updates to the translations have been added to this release. Thanks to everyone who has helped with the translations. Currently, Desk Drive supports 11 languages. That’s pretty amazing considering it was only a month ago that I started asking for translations.

I’m currently working on some code to resolve a problem with icon positioning on multiple monitors where the non-primary monitor has a negative offset from the the primary monitor. It’s a somewhat uncommon scenario but does occur with just enough frequency to warrant investigation. Part of making software “just work” requires digging into the edge cases. That’s why your feedback and suggestions are so valuable. 

Many thanks to the community for your feedback and support. With your help, Desk Drive has become much more than I ever envisioned.
