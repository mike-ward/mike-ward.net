![Dotnet logo](http://az667460.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/images/blog/Blog/dotnet.gif)I wish I had known about this site when I started programming in ASP.NET a few months back. The [Microsoft .NET Quick Start Tutorials](http://quickstarts.asp.net/QuickStartv20/default.aspx) Web site is just the right balance of detail and brevity. It assumes you know a bit about Web programming but extensive knowledge is not necessary. The quick starts only apply to ASP.NET 2.0 technologies despite the name. Perhaps in the future Microsoft will supply additional tutorial on other .NET technologies.

What’s enjoyable about this site is the organisation and density of the material. The summaries and overviews are clearly written and not too long. The detailed sections are short and dense. Just the way I like it. I discovered several features in ASP.NET 2.0 that I did not know exist, like [No Compile Pages](http://quickstarts.asp.net/QuickStartv20/aspnet/doc/tipstricks/default.aspx#nocompilepages). This site also supplies something I could never find in the MSDN documentation, a single page [Web Forms Syntax Reference](http://quickstarts.asp.net/QuickStartv20/aspnet/doc/pages/syntax.aspx). To me, this is pure joy. The section on [Internationalizing Your Application](http://quickstarts.asp.net/QuickStartv20/aspnet/doc/localization/default.aspx) is equally useful. There is also a section that let’s you test drive all the standard ASP.NET server controls including the code used to generate the examples in both C# and VB.

This is a great resource for everyone. Beginners obviously benefit but even seasoned veterans might find a few nuggets, especially in the [Tips and Tricks](http://quickstarts.asp.net/QuickStartv20/aspnet/doc/tipstricks/default.aspx) section.
