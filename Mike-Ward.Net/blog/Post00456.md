OK, not really, but there is a video someone posted on YouTube.

One of the fun things about publishing software is finding out who is using it and how. What’s interesting about this video is that it’s promoting FreeSnap as a Windows 7 style keyboard enhancement. Pretty cool considering I wrote the program way back in 2002.

Checking my logs today, I’m finding that Japan and Germany represent the majority of visits to my Web site. Living here in the States, it’s easy to forget that it’s a big world out there. Taking the time to localize some of my programs has paid off in visits and downloads.
