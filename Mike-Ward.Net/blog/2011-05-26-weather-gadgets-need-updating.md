Weather Gadgets Need Updating
2011-05-26T12:57:02
This morning I noticed that Google changed the format of their weather API. Both the Simply Weather Gadget and Web site are messed up at the moment. It should be a straight forward fix but wouldn’t you know it, I’m on the road this week. With luck I should be able to fix it this evening.

Also, I’ve been getting one or two reports about [tweetz](/tweetz) not working where it worked before. If you see this let me know and more importantly, if you can get me a Fiddler2 log it would help narrow down the issue for me. Thanks - Mike
