Desk Drive 1.8 – Windows 7 Compatible

Perhaps you’ve heard about an announcement from Microsoft about some new Operating System or such? Well, it’s here, it’s cool and it broke some of Desk Drive’s cooler features.

While the shortcuts still appear on the desktop, other features like locus effects, remembered icon positions and opening Windows Explorer were broken. So much for backward compatibility.

In fairness to Microsoft, maintaining compatibility with every application that ever was is perhaps a bit unrealistic. But breaking Desk Drive? Clearly this is one the most important Windows program today. How could they? I feel so jilted (just kidding Microsoft).

In the end it was a pretty easy fix and Desk Drive is running like a champ on Windows 7 now. I’m working on some Windows 7 specific features for future releases so check back often.
