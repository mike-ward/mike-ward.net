Market Report Gadget Update

About a week ago “Market Report”, my dead-simple market index gadget broke. After some investigation I learned that the Yahoo finance API no longer supports the Dow Jones Industrials index. Apparently, there’s some legal reason that recently required them to drop support for DJI.

I’ve changed the gadget to retrieve data from Google instead. Hopefully they won’t be barred from reporting the Dow Jones Industrials index.

Hint: You can change the background colors by hovering your mouse pointer over the gadget and spinning the mouse wheel.
