![](http://assets2.twitter.com/images/twitter.png?1207955067) Everywhere I read, Twitter is a must for bloggers. So I'm giving into the dark side and setting up shop on Twitter. You can follow my tweaks or twips or whatever they're called at [http://twitter.com/blueonion](http://twitter.com/blueonion). If I'm an idiot for doing this then I must also be a twittyidiot! Whatever...
