Here's a simple idea for identifying your USB flash drive. Add a file called Owner.txt to the root folder with your name, address, phone number, email and other contact information. I also offer a reward of replacing the USB flash drive with an equivalent size/quality if it's returned. If you're like most people, the data on the USB flash drive is worth more to you than the memory stick itself. There's no guarantee that the finder will return it but at least you've given them some motivation to try.
