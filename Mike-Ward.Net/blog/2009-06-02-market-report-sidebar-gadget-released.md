![image](http://az667460.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/images/blog/MarketReportSidebarGadgetReleased_11170/image.png) There are a number of “stock ticker” gadgets available for Vista/Windows 7, but as usual, they either don’t work or they try to do too much. I have a more “casual” interest in the market and just want to know what the major indices are doing. 

This gadget is as simple as it gets. Install it and your done. It updates every 15 minutes when the markets are active. Click on the title (Market Report) to open the Yahoo finance page. Use your mouse wheel to change the background to one of four colors. Small, targeted functionality and easy to use. Just what a gadget should be.

Available on the [downloads page](/downloads).
