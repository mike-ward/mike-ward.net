GOA WinForms in Silverlight
2007-06-24T12:46:01
[GOA WinForms](http://community.netikatech.com/demos/) is an implementation of the standard System.Windows.Form .NET library for both Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight. It allows .NET developers to write standard WinForms applications that will run on these two RIA platforms. The look and feel of the package is faithful which is surprising when you consider it is written in JavaScript (a current restriction in Silverlight 1.1 that will be addressed in Silverlight 2.0).

![](http://community.netikatech.com/demos/images/designer.jpg)There are five demos on the site showing off various control groups like buttons, checkboxes, data grids and tool strips. Perhaps the most impressive demo is the Visual Studio like Forms Designer. Written entirely in GOA WinForms it allows you to visually design dialogs in much the same way as in Visual Studio.

Be warned, all this is alpha and is a bit buggy (Silverlight itself is still in beta).
