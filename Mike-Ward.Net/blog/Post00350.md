Desk Drive 1.5 Released
2008-08-25T13:38:31
[Desk Drive 1.5](http://mike-ward.net/deskdrive) adds a new feature many of you have asked for -- Remembered icon positions. Plug-in your USB Stick, move the shortcut that appears to a new location on your desktop and Desk Drive will remember to put it there the next time. (Note, this feature only remembers Desk Drive icons, not all the icons on your desktop)

A new checkbox to activate the "Remember icon positions" has been added to the interface. I added localizations for all the currently supported languages using Google translate for this new item. This means the translations are close but probably not quite right. Feel free to send me corrections.

Speaking of languages, version 1.5 adds Portuguese (Brazilian) to the program. Desk Drive currently supports the following languages.

  * German 
  * Italian 
  * Slovenian 
  * Chinese 
  * Japanese 
  * Finnish 
  * Portuguese (Brazilian) 

Adding new languages to Desk Drive couldn't be easier. Locate the **DeskDrive.exe.xml** file (usually located in C:\Program Files\Blue Onion Software\Desk Drive) and change the items labeled "default" to reflect your language. Send it to me and I'll add it to the next release.
