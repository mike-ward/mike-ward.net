I love little gems like this one. [Comment Reflower](http://commentreflower.sourceforge.net/) is a plugin for Visual Studio 2003 and 2005 that word wraps comments in source files. It's fairly intelliegent in that it tries to stylize comments based on the content allowing you to easily create and maintain nice looking bullet lists, examples and preformatted areas. Release 1.4 adds a handy "align parameters" option that will neatly align method parameters across multiple lines.

Comment Reflower is language neutral in implementation, and comes with initial settings to handle all the comment block types within C++/ C# and Visual Basic files, as well as settings to handle a number of common bullet points and all the Doxygen tag styles. However Comment Reflower is also fully configurable, so support for new languange types is easily added via the configuration GUI, shown below.

It's free, it's seemless and it just works.
