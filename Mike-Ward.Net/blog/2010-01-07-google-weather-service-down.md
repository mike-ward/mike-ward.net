Google Weather Service Down
2010-01-07T13:16:05
Several of you have reported that Simply Weather is stuck on Tuesday. Indeed it is and it’s because Google’s Weather Service is broken at the moment. Here’s what I get when I search for the current weather conditions in Google Search (“Weather 48176”)

As you can see, the forecast and current conditions are two days old. Hopefully, Google will fix it soon.
